2818,1191,3/30/2009,10952,Lam,Daniel is really cool. The place was nice and clean. Very quiet neighborhood. He had maps and a lonely planet guide book in the room for you to use. I didnt have any trouble finding the place from Central Station. I would defintely come back! Thanks!
515749,1671407,7/9/2012,2640670,Gregory,"If you want the authentic Amsterdam houseboat experience, this is it!  It is a great boat, located on a quiet canal with a view of the Rijksmuseum towers.  Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, hot shower, good wifi signal, nice kitchen with fridge, cofee maker, and stove for cooking meals.  The location is very accessible to museums, gym bar and bakery on the corner, nine streets area with lots of resaraunts and bars and jazz clubs, Vondelpark, shopping on Utrechtstraat, and all of the sites of central Amsterdam.    Now for the special part: If you are at all interested in boats and maritime history, this one is a great find.  The cabin where guests stay is actually the cargo hold within the original hull of a freight boat that once hauled goods all over Holland.  (Just imagine the countless tons of cargo that came in and out of the place where you are sleeping!)  And yet the interior beautifully and comfortably remodeled using new and salvaged materials including a number of hatches that serve as skylights.  The original steerhouse is still intact, along with the original one-cylinder engine down below.  But the highlight is the captain's quarters where the family who owned and operated the boat lived during the 1920s (not open for guests to sleep in, yet).  Stepping down into the quarters, complete with original cabinets and cookstove, feels like traveling back in time.  The host cares a lot about preserving the historical character of his boat, because most other boats like it have long since gone to the scrapyard.  He showed us fascinating photographs of the original owners who lived on the boat when it plied the canals nearly 100 years ago.    There are many houseboats in Amsterdam.  A lot of them are glorified trailer houses on flat barges.  This one is a gem."
515749,1715674,7/15/2012,1032804,Michael,"Unique and luxurious to be sure. I couldn't recommend staying with Derk any more highly.  Coolest thing first: We showed up to Derk's and he actually had three houseboats in a row, and offered to show up the one we saw on the site and another, and let us choose our favorite to stay in!  We had an incredible boat with wired internet, a comfortable bed and a very comfortable futon, TV, speakers, hot water, a shower, washer/dryer.  I couldn't believe I was on a boat.  Plus the charm of being on one was fantastic, and the views out onto the canal were fantastic.  It rained one morning and was such a beautiful way to wake up.  In addition, Derk was really communicative, responded to our last minute (day before!) request for a reservation quite casually, and met us right at the boat.  He even had a few cold beers in the fridge for us, and was really great explaining the area.  Would recommend!"
2818,1771,4/24/2009,12798,Alice,"Daniel is the most amazing host! His place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). He is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. Highly recommended!"
515749,1963378,8/12/2012,503786,Brian,"My wife and I recently stopped in Amsterdam for a few days during our honeymoon. We didn't want to stay in the typical Amsterdam hotel and opted for something special - a traditional Dutch houseboat.  Needless to say staying on a boat was a special experience, but the boat was very clean, was on a quiet canal in a superb location in central Amsterdam, and had everything we needed for a memorable weekend.  The owner was good to make some worthwhile recommendations for us and was very flexible with the boat itself (he offered us his other boat in case we preferred that one), etc.  I will definitely try to book this houseboat again when I return to Amsterdam next."
515749,2073958,8/23/2012,2869021,Nadége,"Nous avons pass 5 jours parfait chez Derk! Le quartier est super sympa, très calme et très central. Tout est à proximité directe,louer des vélos permet de se the placer facilement et de découvrir la ville autrement ! Notre séjour sur la péniche a été très sympa. C'est trés mignon, bien equipé, avec une vue magnifique sur le rijksmuseum, sur un petit bout de canal calme et ensoleillé.Derk a été adorable! Nous avons adoré cette expérience et nous recommandons vivement!"
515749,2221365,9/7/2012,2804901,Anita,"Location is Perfect with-in walking distance of Vondelpark, Van Gogh Museum, Heineken museum, Dam square, Waterlooplein market and of course Jordaan’s charming lanes.  (hire a bike from around the corner, travel one side of the city to the other in minutes!)  Every corner you turn has something to offer.  The boat is moored on a quite, peaceful, picturesque canal. Cafe, restaurants, bars, supermarket and shops all minutes away. Derk is such a nice guy, he was extremely helpful and is so laid back. His home is yours and you feel very welcome. The boat is charming, clean and comfortable (we got a choice of boats, which ever suited us best!)  Instant running hot water, wifi, cooker the lot all you need for a comfy stay. We took our 2.5yr old with us and she felt she was in a fairytale, sleeping on a boat, she got up each morning to feed the swans and ducks from the boat, and then later swam naked with all the other toddlers in Vondelpark fountains. We left planing our next stay, so I really can not recommend this holiday anymore, it was perfect. If you want a unique, unforgettable experience then go for this boat. "
2818,1989,5/3/2009,11869,Natalja,"We had such a great time in Amsterdam. Daniel is an excellent host! Very friendly and everytime helpful. The room was cozy, comfortable, and VERY clean. Maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. Bathroom with all the bathroom requires. Good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center. Totally recommendable! "
2818,2797,5/18/2009,14064,Enrique,Very professional operation. Room is very clean and comfortable. Location is close to tram or bus which take you to most of attractions. A great and helpful host who want to ensure you enjoy your stay.  
2818,3151,5/25/2009,17977,Sherwin,Daniel is highly recommended.  He provided all necessities (and actually went way beyond what's expected of a great host). His place is very clean.  It is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  You will truly feel like a local here.
2818,4748,6/29/2009,20192,Jie,"Daniel was a great host! He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!  "
2818,5202,7/7/2009,23055,Vanessa,"Daniele is an amazing host! He provided everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable and easy! The rooms were clean and cozy; and he took the time to show us how to get around Amsterdam via public transportation or riding around on bicycles. You truly do feel like a local when staying with Daniele!! "
515749,2277642,9/14/2012,3073584,Marcelo,"I lived in Amsterdam for three years and away wondered what it would be like to stay in a house boat - the experience was excellent and Derek is a great guy, very easygoing and flexible. Highly recommended."
515749,2391406,9/24/2012,3155853,Klaus,"Das Boot ist super! Es liegt in einer sehr ruhigen Gracht, genau das richtig um sich auszuruhen und trotzdem so zentral, dass du alles leicht zu Fuß erreichen kannst ( 15 min gehen und du bist im Nachtleben von Amsterdam, 30 min gehen und du bist am Bahnhof, 5 min Frühstück, 10 min Supermarkt) Es ist zweckmäßig eingerichtet. Es ist alles vorhanden, was du braucht, auch wenn du dich selbst verpflegst.  Derk ist ein sehr netter, freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Vermieter"
515749,2469203,10/1/2012,2532611,Katja,"We stayed on Derk's boat for a long weekend in Amsterdam. It was great! Sadly we didn't meet Derk, as he was on holiday, so we didn't get to learn the history of the boat as some other guests have. But he left us in good hands with a friend, who met us at the boat to give us the keys and show us around. Rain on the boat's roof is the most soothing thing at nighttime... slept like a baby!!! "
515749,2505468,10/4/2012,3482158,Katie,"Derk's boat was amazing.  It was clean and spacious for two people and had all necessary amenities (and more!) to comfortably stay for a few days.  The location was great, 15 minute walk to downtown and red light district, bike rentals right around the corner, 5 minutes to grocery store, yet still in a quiet neighborhood.   Derk was a great host as well.  He was there waiting for us when we arrived and made sure we could hook up to wifi and had all of his contact info in case we had to reach him.  He was a really friendly guy- even left us a couple beers in the fridge.    We highly recommend staying here! "
515749,2721446,10/26/2012,2909223,Nick,"This is a great place to stay in the heart of Amsterdam. It's a hop, skip and a jump from everything and anything you might want to do.  You get a true houseboat experience - a must from anyone visiting the city.  Derk was a gracious host, very friendly and open for any questions we might have had.  It was a joy to be there."
515749,2760672,10/30/2012,3538997,Kevin And Nicky,"The Houseboat was truly fabulous. A great location, less than 10 minutes walk from Rembrandt Square. The boat is warm, spacious, has a good shower and was so much better than a hotel room. Derk was an excellent host, waiting up for us despite our very late arrival. He was always contactable but left us to ourselves. We would highly recommend staying with Derk and we are sure we will do so again in the future."
515749,2824656,11/7/2012,3573614,Giulia,"The Houseboat was very nice, and the location perfect, very close to the center of Amsterdam. The boat is warm, romantic, and full equiped. Derk was an excellent host, always contactable but left us to ourselves. It was a very beautiful experience!"
515749,2965064,11/26/2012,3253052,Elias,"First rate all around. The houseboat is cosy, comfortable and has everything you need for a stay. The restaurants and bars in the nearby UtrechtStraat are superb. Location wise this is perfect for Amsterdam - you can walk anywhere you want and yet it is a quiet residential area. Highly recommend it."
515749,3027370,12/4/2012,3737577,Mathilde,The location is perfect and the boat is perfect. Derk is really helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam.

515749,3661225,3/1/2013,554380,Emily,"We had such a lovely warm and comfortable stay on Derk’s houseboat. The boat is in a great location; it is very close to some main streets and sights in Amsterdam but is on a quiet residential street. We visited all the attractions whilst in Amsterdam and we were able to walk to each one. There are restaurants, cafes, bakeries all close by. The boat is centrally heated so even though it was freezing outside it was lovely and warm inside. The boat as a whole is much more spacious that it appears in the photos and he bed is very comfortable too!! Ill be recommending Derk’s houseboat to anyone I know going to Amsterdam. We will definitely be back to stay!! :)"
515749,3805178,3/17/2013,1517970,Mark,"We had a fantastic stay on the houseboat, even though it was freezing March weather and the ducks were skating on the frozen canal, the boat was very warm and comfortable. The location is perfect, central, but quiet and Derk even arranged tickets to the opera for us - a real bonus and our best night of the trip - thanks Derk, we will definitely be back to experience the boat and Amsterdam in the warmer weather :)"
515749,3861275,3/22/2013,2654204,Rasmus,"We had the best time in Amsterdam, and Derks houseboat was a great part of that! Good location in a quiet place, warm and cosy houseboat, and a nice and helpful host:)  We already miss it!"

515749,4181330,4/16/2013,5057493,Carlos,"Staying in a boat in Amsterdam really improved my experience in the city! The boat is super well located, I barely had the need to use public transport. Nice and polite host. Highly recommended! "
515749,4292703,4/25/2013,5581202,Jessica,"Staying on the houseboat was one of the highlights of an already wonderful trip. It was spacious, clean and such a lovely experience. The boat is in a very central location, restaurants, shops, cafes and the tram are all very close by. Derk was a wonderful host. We'd love to stay here again on our next trip!"
515749,4427164,5/5/2013,4655557,Rosane,"For a first experience with airbnb, we're fully satisfied. We had a great time in Amsterdam on Derk's houseboat. Everything was as expected. just one little ""minus"":  The heat was off (of course, we're in May!!) but with this year's cold spring, it was a bit chilly during the night. Thanks to the extra blanket !  We haven't got the chance to meet Derk, but his neighbor was waiting for us with the keys, so everything went well.  We certainly would recommand that place, and if we come back to Amsterdam, we'll certainly rent it again. Rosane and Romain/Nyon,Switzerland"
785432,3106041,12/17/2012,1577936,Gemma,"Fantastic! location, comfort, privacy, freedom... all under one boat roof. Daan is an excellent host - all you could ask for. really. What you see is what you get and doesn't it look awesome?"
785432,3189695,12/30/2012,2473746,Laura,"Daan is an excellent host and very helpfull - The houseboat is fantastic : clean, comfort, good location. I will recommand this location to all my friends.  "
2818,9131,9/6/2009,26343,Katja,"You can´t have a nicer start in Amsterdam. Daniel is such a great and welcoming host. The room was really light and charming, so well decorated. Daniel has a great sense of hospitality, he even helped with our luggage and gave us maps and a travelguide. He´s very open minded and helpful. We had a great time, we would stay with him again anytime we´re back in Amsterdam. Daniel made sure we had everything for a great trip, thanks again for the bikes! Hope to see you soon, Daniel!"
2818,12103,10/1/2009,40999,Marie-Eve,"Daniel was a fantastic host. His place is calm and clean, and he provided so much information on how to enjoy the amazing city of Amsterdam. Should I return to the city, his place will be my first choice! "
785432,3221509,1/2/2013,4140013,Emilie,"Nous étions 5 personnes et nous avons été agréablement surpris par la péniche de Dann.  Elle est très bien située, propre et bien équipée. Nous avons tous apprécié le séjour.  Nous remercions Daan pour son accueil.  Benoîte, Christelle, Faustine, Vincent et Emilie"
515749,4741067,5/23/2013,4504364,Leonie,"We loved our stay in Derk's barge. It was so very comfortable and warm, with plenty of room. Lovely hot shower. It was very handy to transport and we had no difficulty finding the local bakery for our croissants. Derk very kindly waited up til our midnight arrival so he could meet us and show us around, and also showed us the rest of the barge which still has its original features.  Would readily recommend Derk's barge and hope we can return some day. We are a retired couple from New Zealand and it was great to have something so different to what we can find in our country."
515749,4769717,5/25/2013,1025881,Matthias,"Great place to stay and discover the city. Especially our little ones enjoyed the special atmosphere on the boat. Derk and his wife  gave us a really warm welcome and were very flexible with regards to our requests / check-in, check-out time. Thank you. "
515749,4835983,5/28/2013,5436505,Roland,"Highly recommended! We had a very comfortable 3 night stay at this house boat. Fantastic atmosphere, and the location is excellent!"
515749,5076516,6/11/2013,2735004,Tina,We had a lovely weekend on the house boat and Derk is very easy going and helpful.  Very authentic and cosy boat. Highly recommend. Enjoy.
515749,5140747,6/15/2013,3642188,Cécile,"This houseboat is the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam. Very quiet and peaceful and close to the city center. The houseboat in itself is as stated: very spacious, well furnished and comfortable. Derk was great as a host. At check-in, we came very early in the morning to leave our luggage and did the same at check-out....very convenient.  Cécile "
515749,5511597,7/3/2013,6534113,Christopher,Location and setting truly can't be beat. Had a great stay!
515749,5576034,7/7/2013,5527856,Emma,Derk Lottman is an absolute gentleman. he was there when we arrived and introduce us to the boat which is charming and full of character. An absolute delight to stay there. The canal is quiet and charming as is the location. Loved Amsterdam. You must try the Bar moustache. We will be back  
515749,5727992,7/14/2013,660722,Marina,"The boat is something special! It seems so authentic to live in the houseboat while staying in Amsterdam! There is a lot of space and it's so cosy. And there is everything one can need including hot water, wi-fi and TV) It's 5 min wals to Rembrandt place and 15 min walk to Red Quarter. And you can get to Amsterdam Centraal in 15 min by tram. Many thanks to Derk - everything was just fantastic!"
515749,5882693,7/21/2013,1179565,Frances,"We spent 3 nights on this unique houseboat.  It has a great location (we did all museums, canal exploring, central Amsterdam ... on foot) and it is very tranquil.  The boat is very comfortable and well-equipped for self-catering. There are food shops, cafés, restaurants nearby.  We highly recommend it as part of the Amsterdam experience!  "
515749,5962835,7/24/2013,1816228,Stuart,"We spent three night's on Derk's houseboat and absolutely loved it. It was clean, fully equipped and the location was perfect, within walking distance of Rembrandtplein square in one direction and the Van Gogh Museum and  Rijksmuseum in another. The wifi worked perfectly and was surprisingly fast. Derk is a very interesting guy (a violinist with De Nederlandse Opera company) and dropped by twice to make sure we had everything we needed - which we did. It was a quintessential Amsterdam experience that we highly recommend. "
2818,16196,11/4/2009,38623,Graham,"Daniel was great. He couldn.t do enough for us. He has gone to a lot of trouble and added every little touch to his apartment. He can speak 5 languages so that should not be a problem for anyone. The accomation had everything we needed and was very convienient to the bus and tram."
2818,18095,11/23/2009,48138,Klaus,"Daniel has been more then a great host: it was like having an home in Amsterdam! If friendliness and kindness were not enough, the house was super clean and he provided all the things needed for our staying: maps, timetables, suggestions and tips, even bicycles! The location is easy to get to and from the station and the city center, 24h/24h connection, with a relaxing and serviced neighborhood. And don't worry, he speaks 5 languages if you mind having communication problems. Hope to find other guest like him in the future!"
2818,18286,11/25/2009,55661,Michael,"Daniel's apartment and room was spotless. Daniel was very friendly throughout our correspondence and was even waiting for me outside his place when I arrived (late). The apartment is very convenient to the center of the city, and an easy walk to the transportation stops. Daniel is well prepared for any guest, providing me with maps and bus schedules. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Daniel is wonderful host."
2818,24925,1/27/2010,33284,Araz,"Daniel was an exeptional host!! We only had a short stay in Amsterdam but Daniel was extremely helpful as he had all the local transport timetables mapped out and ready for us to use. His place was very clean and comfortable. Daniel was incredibly accommodating on our last day in Amsterdam. Our flight wasn't till the evening and he was kind enough to let us leave our luggage for the day and return to pick them up before our flight. TOTALLY, TOTALLY, TOTALLY recommend Daniel's place next time you visit Amsterdam."
2818,31154,3/24/2010,82918,Natalie,"No amount of praise for Daniel would be corny or excessive.  His place was comfortable and wonderful, and he is an incredibly friendly and accommodating host.  I felt cleaner, safer, and happier than at any hotel.  A friend and I stayed here, and we loved having the twin beds in the same room.  The shower was luxurious and clean, and Daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  I just asked my travel companion ""What else can I say about Daniel's place?"" and he was like, ""OH MAN!  It's one thing to expect breakfast from a B&B, and it's quite another to be chez Daniel.  His command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched."""
2818,35916,4/16/2010,97200,Ludovic,"It's the perfect place: clean, safe, noiseless, with a perfect owner.  Moreover with the hash from Island, we were stucked in amstedam and daniel help us a lot. So thanks you Daniel. If you have to come to Amsterdam, choose the Daniel's place and you will enjoy your holidays."
2818,36774,4/19/2010,103149,Faisal,"When you reach at Dainel place, be sure that all things are ready to greet you. May it be meticulously made room or spick & span bathroom or well-thought-of information on ""Things To Do"" along with relevant maps & transportation schedule to explore the city to the fullest. Nothing misses out from Daniel's radar. His pleasing personality with great asthetic sense is just an icing on the cake.We would definately stay with him again.Thanks again for making us feel at home."
2818,39856,5/3/2010,112391,Rickey,"Daniel is a terrific host, like one of the other people stated Danile provided me with great maps and recommendations. I would stay with Daniel again anytime. "
2818,45708,5/24/2010,79479,David,Daniel was a fantastic host and we would absolutely stay again with him. Everything was as advertised and you can easily get anywhere from his apartment. 
2818,48766,6/1/2010,99878,Josh,"Our stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of mine and my partner's whirlwind European tour. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think Zen), but having Daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam.   The room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. We were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes Daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.  I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. As a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming.   P.S. You can check my YouTube page for videos of our stay in Amsterdam, which includes a peek into the room: (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
2818,54108,6/17/2010,131821,Amelia,"Daniel was very accomodating and friendly. It was a little pricey for what it was. The bed was smaller than a dormitory bed, and as a college student, I would know. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe but I did get hassled a few times outside of the apartment. Overall, I was impressed but I probably would stay closer to the city center in the future."
2818,54654,6/19/2010,97097,Jenn,Daniel's place was great! We got so much relaxing in. We loved staying there are really appreciated his great hospitality! He gave us great tips on getting around etc. I would recommend his place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam.
2818,58048,6/27/2010,147769,Andrew,"Just a short note - my first experience with AirBnB was with Daniel and it was stellar.  Exactly as indicated and advertised, the service was exemplary.  As a person who does a lot of business travelling, I found Daniel to be an informed and professional host.  Much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  I highly recommend Daniel to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam, the experience was completely positive."
2818,62552,7/8/2010,15745,David,"Daniel was an exceptional host!  I was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:  1) Friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- Along with my reservation I received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at Daniel's doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).  2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel's apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.  3) All the ""little extras"" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.  Everything was well thought-out and Daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb."
2818,73222,8/3/2010,164729,Michel,"Daniel is a great host. He is a very sweet and courteous person and he seems to truly enjoy hosting guests. His apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). He provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that I can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. Daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him. Thank you Daniel."
2818,74084,8/5/2010,171625,Lezle,"We spent two nights at Daniel's and very much enjoyed it. Early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. The room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. His place is a bit out of the central area of Amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. It was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. We would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!"
515749,6102263,7/30/2013,72642,Will,Great communication by Derk he was quick to respond with any inquiries. The houseboat was really quite large with plenty of room. The bed is very comfortable. The location is very close to the museums however you are a tram ride to the station and some of the main areas of Amsterdam. However their are several tram stops just minutes away from the place.  Highly recommended. 
515749,6150839,8/1/2013,4154919,Ty,"Derk's houseboat is the absolute best place to stay in Amsterdam. There's no better way to experience the city than by staying on the end of a quiet canal in a great area, surrounded by restaurants and walking distance to the museums. The houseboat is spacious and comes with all the comforts of home with the added addition of being able to sit up on deck and take in the canal life. Derk was a great host, going over the quirks of the accommodations and surrounding area with us. Can't wait to come back to Amsterdam and stay here again."
515749,6297784,8/7/2013,465033,Maarit,"A wonderful place to stay in Amsterdam. We enjoyed the location, quiet but so close to many nice areas to wonder in and eat at. We had a great time and enjoyed relaxing on the boat!"
515749,6373581,8/10/2013,1535004,Eleanor,"What a beautiful place to stay!  Really, do stay here if you possibly can - it is a wonderful, spacious boat - plenty of room for two or three people - and on a beautiful canal - a perfect base for exploring Amsterdam. Easy to get to from the center of the city, and a pleasant walk away from the big museums. Derk was very friendly and helpful, even when our flight got in early - a wonderful host! "
785432,3301352,1/7/2013,2231747,Lucie & Max,"Wonderful place to stay in the very center of Amsterdam, the house boat is just perfect, cosy and well equiped. You can see the Hermitage Museum and the City hall from the window. We were here in January so we couldn't really enjoy the roof top, it is surely very pleasant in summer time. Daan was very kind and help us with the car, gave us good advice and tips about the city. He was always availlable to help. Thanx a lot truly for these fews days in Amsterdam, on a Houseboat !"
785432,3437158,1/29/2013,4578307,Silvia,"It has been amazing to spend a week end in Amsterdam sleeping on a houseboat: a unique experience!  The place is very nice and cosy, the host very kind and always availlable for anything you need.  The boat is really in the heart of the city, a very pretty neighbourhood full of restaurants, bars and shops. Also, the Metro station makes very easy to reach the Central Station and the Airport. I will definitely come back!!"
2818,87063,8/30/2010,175043,Andrew,"Daniel was an excellent host, and I whole heartedly recommend his accomodations. He is pleasant, the place was very clean, and the location was perfect - a 10-15 minute bus or metro ride to downtown and quiet in the evening. On my next visit to Amsterdam, I would absolutely stay with Daniel again. "
2818,91025,9/6/2010,105289,Nadia,Daniel is a fantastic host who cares about the details of his guest's stay in Amsterdam. He was a blessing when it came to getting directions of where we needed to go. He definitely comes excellently-recommended!
785432,3450037,1/31/2013,1803302,Lacey,We had a great time! Thanks so much for welcoming us to Amsterdam! It was great fun bragging to our friends in NYC that we stayed on the canal.
785432,3574220,2/18/2013,2421794,Marat,"Our experience was amazing! In first, the boat is located in perfect place, near subway and moorings of most popular touristic boat lines. It is really center of Amsterdam. Next advantage is facilities on the boat. At morning you can make a cup of coffee and enjoy it on the boat stern looking at canal and nice buildings and bridge. And finally, just in a few hours you'll have great skill of entering inside boat through the small door :-)"
785432,3614980,2/26/2013,4572050,Barbara,"We've been 4 days on the fantastic houseboat - I only can highly recommend it... As from the beginning with making the reservation, through e-mailing back and forth for clearing details etc. and finally leaving the boat at the end of our stay - everything worked out perfectly. We loved the attitude, the welcoming atmosphere and the caring, we felt from Daan throughout the whole time... Even got a hairdryer shortly of our stay at his boat...  All I can say: we are coming back as soon as possible - the next time preferably in spring or summer to take advantage of the terrace for seizing evening time...  Thanks a lot for everything and cu soon again in beautiful AMS-city - with these great shops, restaurants and the Stadthaus (Theatre and Operahouse) just some meters away from the boat... Barbara"
785432,3691290,3/4/2013,2009045,Paul&Rebecca,"Daan was a great host and we really enjoyed staying in his houseboat.  Location is very nice, apartment was very clean and comfortable."
785432,3744031,3/11/2013,983934,Andrea,"Daan was a super friendly and helpful host. He was very quick to reply to my messages before arrival and also very reliable during the trip. He had answers to all our questions and adviced us well. Following his recommendation we went to a very nice bar, we would never have found otherwise. The boat itself is wonderful, as is the location.  It's clean, quite and very comfortable and you reach everything in the city in 10 minutes. We would go back to stay at Daan's houseboat as soon as we get a chance to. I can highly recommend this place!"
785432,3782902,3/14/2013,5155193,Marc,4 jours formidables à visiter une ville formidable ! Attention malgré tout au froid et au vent en mars...
785432,3814495,3/18/2013,2036440,Marie,"Super séjour, super péniche! Clean, bien équipée et parfaitement située. Daan a été super avec nous. On reviendra! (en été, pour profiter un max de la superbe terrasse)"
785432,3927466,3/28/2013,1144382,Maya,"Daan's houseboat was wonderful--GREAT location, clean, completely outfitted for everything you would need, and a lovely rooftop patio for warmer evenings or morning coffee. A fully equipped kitchen allowed us to pick up fresh pasteries, yogurt nd fruit for simple, quick and delicious breakfasts. Daan was incredibly responsive in advance of our arrival, sending great directions and accommodating our early check-in. He also gave us excellent recommendations for dinner both nights that we were there. Highly recommended for a true Amsterdam canal experience."
785432,3944667,3/29/2013,1986682,Thad,"Daan's Houseboat was a treat to stay on. Not only was the boat tidy and comfortable, the location and ambiance was spot on. Daan gave a thorough introduction to staying aboard and was a pleasure to meet. Our group of five was very satisfied with the evening. I look forward to  staying here again."
785432,3954478,3/30/2013,5560745,Jeroen,"Leuke boot, hele centrale ligging in Amsterdam (Metro Waterlooplein). Schoon en compleet. Eigenaar is flexibel en relaxed."
785432,4024160,4/3/2013,5347016,Chris,"Daan was a great host - helpful and very friendly, which gave us a good impression about the city to start with.   The boat was very spacious, well equipped and amazingly quiet, given there were so much going on outside on the river. There were enough rooms for our group of four adults and two kids. The owner even provided a great collection of DVD titles in his boat so you could always keep yourself entertained. All of us enjoyed the stay very much (my son kept asking me ""when can we go back to our boat?"" when we did our sight seeing there).   The location of the boathouse, as the name indicates, is so central that you are virtually within walking distances to many attractions, Rembrandt House Museum, Heritage Amsterdam (where Van Gogh was exhibited until the end of Apr 2013), Handbags and Purses Museum (the one and only in the world) and many others. I had my best coffee of the trip at a corner coffee shop (Puccini) about 5 min away and the restaurant opposite was equally brilliant (Frenzi)."
785432,4041199,4/5/2013,1484609,Andrea,"We stayed two nights with our three teenage boys at Daan's boat. The boat is brilliant - spacious, perfectly located, equiped with everything you might need, clean and comfortable. We even prefered staying in for the meals to going to a restaurant because being on the boat was such a great fun. Daan is really friendly and very helpful. We had a perfect stay and hope to come back soon. "
785432,4230988,4/21/2013,4654565,Pat,My family (5 adults and a 3 y/o child) and I had a great time on Daan's houseboat! The houseboat  was a conveniently located and supplied all that we needed. The accomodations are clean and comfortable.  Daan was helpful and friendly.  Being directly on the canal offered us a very unique experience.  Loved it!
785432,4267882,4/23/2013,5280762,Sinead,"Myself and three friends stayed on Daan's boat for two nights and we had a great experience. We did not want to leave the boat.: ) It was lovely to be able to sit up on top and watch all the boats going by on the canal. The boat itself was very spacious and very well equipped with everything we could possibly need. The location is really good - only a minute from the metro and there is a bike hire shop a few minutes away.  We found Daan to be very friendly and helpful in suggesting ideas for our stay in Amsterdam.  We would highly recommend staying on this boat and hope that we will be back at some stage in the future. "
785432,4290349,4/25/2013,5124445,Kathleen,We had a wonderful and unique experience staying in Daan's houseboat in Amsterdam. The boat was comfortable and located in a fantastic location near many bars and cafes. It was great to stay on the water and wake up to such a beautiful view!
785432,4321026,4/28/2013,4752867,Cristina,Thanks Daan for making us welcome! Staying in an housboat in Amsterdam was a wonderful experience and we suggest everybody to do the same by you! 
785432,4426860,5/5/2013,3919221,Anna&Paul,"If you are looking for an original place to stay, this houseboat is the good plan! Very comfy and in the center of the city, you will find everything needed on this floating flat. Daan is very helpful and welcoming, don't hesitate! "
785432,4469491,5/7/2013,4722770,Margarita,"The Houseboat was great and if opportunity presents itself, I would repeat the experience.  There was, however, miscommunication between the Owner and a person who was to check us in, which resulted in a bit of panic and lost time."
785432,4610646,5/15/2013,565006,Amy,"Daan and his wife were great hosts. The boat is really cute with a great bathtub and a very comfy bed (and good, fast, free wifi). It was fun to see the other tourists going by on tour boats, taking pictures of me on Daan's boat because they thought I was the real deal. The location is excellent - within a five minute walk of several excellent Indonesian restaurants. All in all, a great way to experience Amsterdam. "
515749,6417228,8/12/2013,3917544,Martine,"Belle expérience originale , le bateau est très bien placé pour le quartier des musées et les restaurants proches. Derk est quelqu'un de fort sympathique et dévoué ."
515749,6484938,8/14/2013,4129141,Baine,"This was fantastic!  Derk's houseboat was comfortable, perfectly-located, and fun.  Can't think of a better place to stay in Amsterdam.  And Derk was friendly and accommodated our late arrival, which was great.  Hope to go back for a longer time soon!  "
515749,6595696,8/18/2013,7745769,Kelly,"Charming houseboat with a great location. We enjoyed a two night stay, it was quiet and cosy and Derk gave us a lovely welcome. He was also very helpful in sorting out a small problem with the boat and loaning us a iphone charger. Overall a great guy! The houseboat is in a residential street so it was quiet, but close to transport and shops. We had some lovely evenings sitting out on the deck picnicking and watching the world go by. Look for the Albert Heijn supermarket near the corner of Utrecht Straat and Frederiks Plein and the Dirk supermarket in Marie Heineken Plein. Also De Carosel restaurant on Weteringplantsoen makes wonderful pancakes and poffertjies. And on Vijzelgracht go to Holtkamp bakery for appletart and freshly prepared kroketten. It is also a short walk to the newly opened Rijksmuseum. Buy tickets online and arrive shortly before it opens at 9:00 to miss the worst of the crowds and go see The Night Watch by Rembrant first. So enjoyed Amsterdam, great city."
515749,6777413,8/25/2013,5415727,Christophe,"Derk let us have an environment where you will feel quickly as the maison.Une great experience. The place is quiet and very well placed. we stayed for a week  Thank you Derk"
2818,94243,9/10/2010,202035,Agam,"Daniel's setup was very good.  Like other reviewers have said before, he has a lot of nice little touches and everything is extremely well thought out in providing a seamless experience for his guests.    Daniel himself was really nice and accommodating.  He helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.  His place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  Also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  So it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.  There are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  Would definitely stay there agin."
2818,97728,9/15/2010,211004,Alexandra,"Our stay at Daniel was awesome. He has a beautiful flat which is very tidy and neat. The room to rent is also very nice. It has two comfy beds and a wardrobe. Daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. There are also towels for which Daniel provides a special space in the bathroom.  What was outstanding, was that Daniel also lent us two of his bikes. This was most helpful as we hadn't to figure out the public transport and were free to discover Amsterdam by bike. Even if you would have to take the bus or tram the appartment is located idealy to various stops. "
2818,105516,9/26/2010,217961,Sam,"my stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of of my visit to amsterdam. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable , but having Daniel as a point of reference was my key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever i had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. The room is located at quite 15 minut from the heart of the city, but i didn't find this hindering. i was able to get to the center in 15 minut. also the bus stop is only 3 minut walk from the house . There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living. I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels.definetly will be goin there again thank you daniel so much for everything u done for me to make my stay very confortable..    "
515749,6845389,8/27/2013,6578543,Dominique,"Very pleasant experience in quiet and lovely place. Thanks Derk for your kindness. Hope come back soon !"
515749,7299328,9/15/2013,5923442,Gary,"September 2013 We stayed 5 nights on Derk's houseboat. He met us for an early check-in after our 7 hour flight from Canada and was most welcoming and helpful giving us advice on what was available in the area. The houseboat was warm and comfortable on a quiet canal away from the busy ""touristy"" area. This was our first stay with Airbnb and we were very pleased with the experience."
515749,7360044,9/17/2013,3594917,Cailey,"Derk's houseboat was lovely! Although we did not get a chance to meet it was very easy to correspond and we had an amazing time. Very cozy bed, next to the tram and walking distance to everything we needed. Location could not be beat! Thanks so much for hosting us Derk!"
785432,4645700,5/18/2013,5171993,Ed,"Superb location on the Amstel near to Rembrandtplein and plenty more bars, cafes and restaurants nearby, as well as being very close to the metro and tram. Excellent laidback host - we didn't arrive until 10pm but this wasn't a problem and he lives close by in case of any emergencies. He was also a good source of knowledge of the surrounding area. The houseboat had plenty of room for the four of us with pretty much everything you'd require on a short stay catered for. Overall highly recommended!!!"
