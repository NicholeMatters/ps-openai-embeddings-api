2818,1191,3/30/2009,10952,Lam,Daniel is really cool. The place was nice and clean. Very quiet neighborhood. He had maps and a lonely planet guide book in the room for you to use. I didnt have any trouble finding the place from Central Station. I would defintely come back! Thanks!
515749,1671407,7/9/2012,2640670,Gregory,"If you want the authentic Amsterdam houseboat experience, this is it!  It is a great boat, located on a quiet canal with a view of the Rijksmuseum towers.  Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, hot shower, good wifi signal, nice kitchen with fridge, cofee maker, and stove for cooking meals.  The location is very accessible to museums, gym bar and bakery on the corner, nine streets area with lots of resaraunts and bars and jazz clubs, Vondelpark, shopping on Utrechtstraat, and all of the sites of central Amsterdam.  <br/><br/>Now for the special part: If you are at all interested in boats and maritime history, this one is a great find.  The cabin where guests stay is actually the cargo hold within the original hull of a freight boat that once hauled goods all over Holland.  (Just imagine the countless tons of cargo that came in and out of the place where you are sleeping!)  And yet the interior beautifully and comfortably remodeled using new and salvaged materials including a number of hatches that serve as skylights.  The original steerhouse is still intact, along with the original one-cylinder engine down below.  But the highlight is the captain's quarters where the family who owned and operated the boat lived during the 1920s (not open for guests to sleep in, yet).  Stepping down into the quarters, complete with original cabinets and cookstove, feels like traveling back in time.  The host cares a lot about preserving the historical character of his boat, because most other boats like it have long since gone to the scrapyard.  He showed us fascinating photographs of the original owners who lived on the boat when it plied the canals nearly 100 years ago.  <br/><br/>There are many houseboats in Amsterdam.  A lot of them are glorified trailer houses on flat barges.  This one is a gem."
515749,1715674,7/15/2012,1032804,Michael,"Unique and luxurious to be sure. I couldn't recommend staying with Derk any more highly.<br/><br/>Coolest thing first: We showed up to Derk's and he actually had three houseboats in a row, and offered to show up the one we saw on the site and another, and let us choose our favorite to stay in!  We had an incredible boat with wired internet, a comfortable bed and a very comfortable futon, TV, speakers, hot water, a shower, washer/dryer.  I couldn't believe I was on a boat.  Plus the charm of being on one was fantastic, and the views out onto the canal were fantastic.  It rained one morning and was such a beautiful way to wake up.<br/><br/>In addition, Derk was really communicative, responded to our last minute (day before!) request for a reservation quite casually, and met us right at the boat.  He even had a few cold beers in the fridge for us, and was really great explaining the area.<br/><br/>Would recommend!"
2818,1771,4/24/2009,12798,Alice,"Daniel is the most amazing host! His place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). He is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. Highly recommended!"
515749,1963378,8/12/2012,503786,Brian,"My wife and I recently stopped in Amsterdam for a few days during our honeymoon. We didn't want to stay in the typical Amsterdam hotel and opted for something special - a traditional Dutch houseboat.  Needless to say staying on a boat was a special experience, but the boat was very clean, was on a quiet canal in a superb location in central Amsterdam, and had everything we needed for a memorable weekend.  The owner was good to make some worthwhile recommendations for us and was very flexible with the boat itself (he offered us his other boat in case we preferred that one), etc.  I will definitely try to book this houseboat again when I return to Amsterdam next."
515749,2073958,8/23/2012,2869021,Nadége,"Nous avons pass 5 jours parfait chez Derk! Le quartier est super sympa, très calme et très central. Tout est à proximité directe,louer des vélos permet de se the placer facilement et de découvrir la ville autrement ! Notre séjour sur la péniche a été très sympa. C'est trés mignon, bien equipé, avec une vue magnifique sur le rijksmuseum, sur un petit bout de canal calme et ensoleillé.Derk a été adorable! Nous avons adoré cette expérience et nous recommandons vivement!"
515749,2221365,9/7/2012,2804901,Anita,"Location is Perfect with-in walking distance of Vondelpark, Van Gogh Museum, Heineken museum, Dam square, Waterlooplein market and of course Jordaan’s charming lanes.  (hire a bike from around the corner, travel one side of the city to the other in minutes!) <br/>Every corner you turn has something to offer. <br/>The boat is moored on a quite, peaceful, picturesque canal. Cafe, restaurants, bars, supermarket and shops all minutes away.<br/>Derk is such a nice guy, he was extremely helpful and is so laid back. His home is yours and you feel very welcome.<br/>The boat is charming, clean and comfortable (we got a choice of boats, which ever suited us best!)  Instant running hot water, wifi, cooker the lot all you need for a comfy stay.<br/>We took our 2.5yr old with us and she felt she was in a fairytale, sleeping on a boat, she got up each morning to feed the swans and ducks from the boat, and then later swam naked with all the other toddlers in Vondelpark fountains.<br/>We left planing our next stay, so I really can not recommend this holiday anymore, it was perfect. If you want a unique, unforgettable experience then go for this boat. "
2818,1989,5/3/2009,11869,Natalja,"We had such a great time in Amsterdam. Daniel is an excellent host! Very friendly and everytime helpful. The room was cozy, comfortable, and VERY clean. Maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. Bathroom with all the bathroom requires. Good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center.<br/>Totally recommendable! "
2818,2797,5/18/2009,14064,Enrique,Very professional operation. Room is very clean and comfortable. Location is close to tram or bus which take you to most of attractions. A great and helpful host who want to ensure you enjoy your stay.  
2818,3151,5/25/2009,17977,Sherwin,Daniel is highly recommended.  He provided all necessities (and actually went way beyond what's expected of a great host). His place is very clean.  It is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  You will truly feel like a local here.
2818,4748,6/29/2009,20192,Jie,"Daniel was a great host! He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!<br/><br/>"
2818,5202,7/7/2009,23055,Vanessa,"Daniele is an amazing host! He provided everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable and easy! The rooms were clean and cozy; and he took the time to show us how to get around Amsterdam via public transportation or riding around on bicycles. You truly do feel like a local when staying with Daniele!!<br/>"
515749,2277642,9/14/2012,3073584,Marcelo,"I lived in Amsterdam for three years and away wondered what it would be like to stay in a house boat - the experience was excellent and Derek is a great guy, very easygoing and flexible. Highly recommended."
515749,2391406,9/24/2012,3155853,Klaus,"Das Boot ist super!<br/>Es liegt in einer sehr ruhigen Gracht, genau das richtig um sich auszuruhen und trotzdem so zentral, dass du alles leicht zu Fuß erreichen kannst ( 15 min gehen und du bist im Nachtleben von Amsterdam, 30 min gehen und du bist am Bahnhof, 5 min Frühstück, 10 min Supermarkt) Es ist zweckmäßig eingerichtet. Es ist alles vorhanden, was du braucht, auch wenn du dich selbst verpflegst. <br/>Derk ist ein sehr netter, freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Vermieter"
515749,2469203,10/1/2012,2532611,Katja,"We stayed on Derk's boat for a long weekend in Amsterdam. It was great! Sadly we didn't meet Derk, as he was on holiday, so we didn't get to learn the history of the boat as some other guests have. But he left us in good hands with a friend, who met us at the boat to give us the keys and show us around. Rain on the boat's roof is the most soothing thing at nighttime... slept like a baby!!! "
515749,2505468,10/4/2012,3482158,Katie,"Derk's boat was amazing.  It was clean and spacious for two people and had all necessary amenities (and more!) to comfortably stay for a few days.  The location was great, 15 minute walk to downtown and red light district, bike rentals right around the corner, 5 minutes to grocery store, yet still in a quiet neighborhood. <br/><br/>Derk was a great host as well.  He was there waiting for us when we arrived and made sure we could hook up to wifi and had all of his contact info in case we had to reach him.  He was a really friendly guy- even left us a couple beers in the fridge.  <br/><br/>We highly recommend staying here!<br/>"
515749,2721446,10/26/2012,2909223,Nick,"This is a great place to stay in the heart of Amsterdam. It's a hop, skip and a jump from everything and anything you might want to do.  You get a true houseboat experience - a must from anyone visiting the city.<br/><br/>Derk was a gracious host, very friendly and open for any questions we might have had.<br/><br/>It was a joy to be there."
515749,2760672,10/30/2012,3538997,Kevin And Nicky,"The Houseboat was truly fabulous. A great location, less than 10 minutes walk from Rembrandt Square. The boat is warm, spacious, has a good shower and was so much better than a hotel room.<br/>Derk was an excellent host, waiting up for us despite our very late arrival. He was always contactable but left us to ourselves.<br/>We would highly recommend staying with Derk and we are sure we will do so again in the future."
515749,2824656,11/7/2012,3573614,Giulia,"The Houseboat was very nice, and the location perfect, very close to the center of Amsterdam. The boat is warm, romantic, and full equiped. Derk was an excellent host, always contactable but left us to ourselves. It was a very beautiful experience!"
515749,2965064,11/26/2012,3253052,Elias,"First rate all around. The houseboat is cosy, comfortable and has everything you need for a stay. The restaurants and bars in the nearby UtrechtStraat are superb. Location wise this is perfect for Amsterdam - you can walk anywhere you want and yet it is a quiet residential area. Highly recommend it."
515749,3027370,12/4/2012,3737577,Mathilde,The location is perfect and the boat is perfect. Derk is really helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam. 
515749,3343775,1/14/2013,1184500,Josh & Winnie,"We had a lovely time in Derks houseboat in Amsterdam, great location, fantastic (and exotic!) accomodation and Derk is a lovely guy who is very helpful and friendly. Would recommend 100%<br/>Thanks Derk! See you next time."
515749,3661225,3/1/2013,554380,Emily,"We had such a lovely warm and comfortable stay on Derk’s houseboat. The boat is in a great location; it is very close to some main streets and sights in Amsterdam but is on a quiet residential street. We visited all the attractions whilst in Amsterdam and we were able to walk to each one. There are restaurants, cafes, bakeries all close by. The boat is centrally heated so even though it was freezing outside it was lovely and warm inside. The boat as a whole is much more spacious that it appears in the photos and he bed is very comfortable too!! Ill be recommending Derk’s houseboat to anyone I know going to Amsterdam. We will definitely be back to stay!! :)"
515749,3805178,3/17/2013,1517970,Mark,"We had a fantastic stay on the houseboat, even though it was freezing March weather and the ducks were skating on the frozen canal, the boat was very warm and comfortable. The location is perfect, central, but quiet and Derk even arranged tickets to the opera for us - a real bonus and our best night of the trip - thanks Derk, we will definitely be back to experience the boat and Amsterdam in the warmer weather :)"
515749,3861275,3/22/2013,2654204,Rasmus,"We had the best time in Amsterdam, and Derks houseboat was a great part of that!<br/>Good location in a quiet place, warm and cosy houseboat, and a nice and helpful host:)<br/><br/>We already miss it!"

515749,4181330,4/16/2013,5057493,Carlos,"Staying in a boat in Amsterdam really improved my experience in the city! The boat is super well located, I barely had the need to use public transport. Nice and polite host. Highly recommended! "
515749,4292703,4/25/2013,5581202,Jessica,"Staying on the houseboat was one of the highlights of an already wonderful trip. It was spacious, clean and such a lovely experience. The boat is in a very central location, restaurants, shops, cafes and the tram are all very close by. Derk was a wonderful host. We'd love to stay here again on our next trip!"
515749,4427164,5/5/2013,4655557,Rosane,"For a first experience with airbnb, we're fully satisfied. We had a great time in Amsterdam on Derk's houseboat. Everything was as expected. just one little ""minus"": <br/>The heat was off (of course, we're in May!!) but with this year's cold spring, it was a bit chilly during the night. Thanks to the extra blanket ! <br/>We haven't got the chance to meet Derk, but his neighbor was waiting for us with the keys, so everything went well. <br/>We certainly would recommand that place, and if we come back to Amsterdam, we'll certainly rent it again. Rosane and Romain/Nyon,Switzerland"
785432,3106041,12/17/2012,1577936,Gemma,"Fantastic! location, comfort, privacy, freedom... all under one boat roof. Daan is an excellent host - all you could ask for. really. What you see is what you get and doesn't it look awesome?"
785432,3189695,12/30/2012,2473746,Laura,"Daan is an excellent host and very helpfull - The houseboat is fantastic : clean, comfort, good location. I will recommand this location to all my friends. <br/>"
2818,9131,9/6/2009,26343,Katja,"You can´t have a nicer start in Amsterdam. Daniel is such a great and welcoming host. The room was really light and charming, so well decorated. Daniel has a great sense of hospitality, he even helped with our luggage and gave us maps and a travelguide. He´s very open minded and helpful. We had a great time, we would stay with him again anytime we´re back in Amsterdam. Daniel made sure we had everything for a great trip, thanks again for the bikes! Hope to see you soon, Daniel!"
2818,12103,10/1/2009,40999,Marie-Eve,"Daniel was a fantastic host. His place is calm and clean, and he provided so much information on how to enjoy the amazing city of Amsterdam. Should I return to the city, his place will be my first choice! "
785432,3221509,1/2/2013,4140013,Emilie,"Nous étions 5 personnes et nous avons été agréablement surpris par la péniche de Dann.  Elle est très bien située, propre et bien équipée. Nous avons tous apprécié le séjour.<br/><br/>Nous remercions Daan pour son accueil.<br/><br/>Benoîte, Christelle, Faustine, Vincent et Emilie"
515749,4741067,5/23/2013,4504364,Leonie,"We loved our stay in Derk's barge. It was so very comfortable and warm, with plenty of room. Lovely hot shower. It was very handy to transport and we had no difficulty finding the local bakery for our croissants. Derk very kindly waited up til our midnight arrival so he could meet us and show us around, and also showed us the rest of the barge which still has its original features.  Would readily recommend Derk's barge and hope we can return some day. We are a retired couple from New Zealand and it was great to have something so different to what we can find in our country."
515749,4769717,5/25/2013,1025881,Matthias,"Great place to stay and discover the city. Especially our little ones enjoyed the special atmosphere on the boat. Derk and his wife  gave us a really warm welcome and were very flexible with regards to our requests / check-in, check-out time. Thank you. "
515749,4835983,5/28/2013,5436505,Roland,"Highly recommended! We had a very comfortable 3 night stay at this house boat. Fantastic atmosphere, and the location is excellent!"
515749,5076516,6/11/2013,2735004,Tina,We had a lovely weekend on the house boat and Derk is very easy going and helpful. <br/>Very authentic and cosy boat. Highly recommend. Enjoy.
515749,5140747,6/15/2013,3642188,Cécile,"This houseboat is the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam. Very quiet and peaceful and close to the city center. The houseboat in itself is as stated: very spacious, well furnished and comfortable. Derk was great as a host. At check-in, we came very early in the morning to leave our luggage and did the same at check-out....very convenient. <br/>Cécile "
515749,5511597,7/3/2013,6534113,Christopher,Location and setting truly can't be beat. Had a great stay!
515749,5576034,7/7/2013,5527856,Emma,Derk Lottman is an absolute gentleman. he was there when we arrived and introduce us to the boat which is charming and full of character. An absolute delight to stay there. The canal is quiet and charming as is the location. Loved Amsterdam. You must try the Bar moustache. We will be back  
515749,5727992,7/14/2013,660722,Marina,"The boat is something special! It seems so authentic to live in the houseboat while staying in Amsterdam! There is a lot of space and it's so cosy. And there is everything one can need including hot water, wi-fi and TV) It's 5 min wals to Rembrandt place and 15 min walk to Red Quarter. And you can get to Amsterdam Centraal in 15 min by tram. Many thanks to Derk - everything was just fantastic!"
515749,5882693,7/21/2013,1179565,Frances,"We spent 3 nights on this unique houseboat.  It has a great location (we did all museums, canal exploring, central Amsterdam ... on foot) and it is very tranquil.  The boat is very comfortable and well-equipped for self-catering. There are food shops, cafés,<br/>restaurants nearby.  We highly recommend it as part of the Amsterdam experience!  "
515749,5962835,7/24/2013,1816228,Stuart,"We spent three night's on Derk's houseboat and absolutely loved it. It was clean, fully equipped and the location was perfect, within walking distance of Rembrandtplein square in one direction and the Van Gogh Museum and  Rijksmuseum in another. The wifi worked perfectly and was surprisingly fast. Derk is a very interesting guy (a violinist with De Nederlandse Opera company) and dropped by twice to make sure we had everything we needed - which we did. It was a quintessential Amsterdam experience that we highly recommend.<br/>"
2818,16196,11/4/2009,38623,Graham,"Daniel was great. He couldn.t do enough for us. He has gone to a lot of trouble and added every little touch to his apartment. He can speak 5 languages so that should not be a problem for anyone.<br/>The accomation had everything we needed and was very convienient to the bus and tram."
2818,18095,11/23/2009,48138,Klaus,"Daniel has been more then a great host: it was like having an home in Amsterdam!<br/>If friendliness and kindness were not enough, the house was super clean and he provided all the things needed for our staying: maps, timetables, suggestions and tips, even bicycles! The location is easy to get to and from the station and the city center, 24h/24h connection, with a relaxing and serviced neighborhood. And don't worry, he speaks 5 languages if you mind having communication problems. Hope to find other guest like him in the future!"
2818,18286,11/25/2009,55661,Michael,"Daniel's apartment and room was spotless. Daniel was very friendly throughout our correspondence and was even waiting for me outside his place when I arrived (late). The apartment is very convenient to the center of the city, and an easy walk to the transportation stops. Daniel is well prepared for any guest, providing me with maps and bus schedules. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Daniel is wonderful host."
2818,24925,1/27/2010,33284,Araz,"Daniel was an exeptional host!! We only had a short stay in Amsterdam but Daniel was extremely helpful as he had all the local transport timetables mapped out and ready for us to use. His place was very clean and comfortable. Daniel was incredibly accommodating on our last day in Amsterdam. Our flight wasn't till the evening and he was kind enough to let us leave our luggage for the day and return to pick them up before our flight. TOTALLY, TOTALLY, TOTALLY recommend Daniel's place next time you visit Amsterdam."
2818,31154,3/24/2010,82918,Natalie,"No amount of praise for Daniel would be corny or excessive.  His place was comfortable and wonderful, and he is an incredibly friendly and accommodating host.  I felt cleaner, safer, and happier than at any hotel.  A friend and I stayed here, and we loved having the twin beds in the same room.  The shower was luxurious and clean, and Daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  I just asked my travel companion ""What else can I say about Daniel's place?"" and he was like, ""OH MAN!  It's one thing to expect breakfast from a B&B, and it's quite another to be chez Daniel.  His command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched."""
2818,35916,4/16/2010,97200,Ludovic,"It's the perfect place: clean, safe, noiseless, with a perfect owner.  Moreover with the hash from Island, we were stucked in amstedam and daniel help us a lot. So thanks you Daniel. If you have to come to Amsterdam, choose the Daniel's place and you will enjoy your holidays."
2818,36774,4/19/2010,103149,Faisal,"When you reach at Dainel place, be sure that all things are ready to greet you. May it be meticulously made room or spick & span bathroom or well-thought-of information on ""Things To Do"" along with relevant maps & transportation schedule to explore the city to the fullest. Nothing misses out from Daniel's radar.<br/>His pleasing personality with great asthetic sense is just an icing on the cake.We would definately stay with him again.Thanks again for making us feel at home."
2818,39856,5/3/2010,112391,Rickey,"Daniel is a terrific host, like one of the other people stated Danile provided me with great maps and recommendations. I would stay with Daniel again anytime. "
2818,45708,5/24/2010,79479,David,Daniel was a fantastic host and we would absolutely stay again with him. Everything was as advertised and you can easily get anywhere from his apartment. 
2818,48766,6/1/2010,99878,Josh,"Our stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of mine and my partner's whirlwind European tour. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think Zen), but having Daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. <br/><br/>The room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. We were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes Daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.<br/><br/>I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. As a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming. <br/><br/>P.S. You can check my YouTube page for videos of our stay in Amsterdam, which includes a peek into the room: (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
2818,54108,6/17/2010,131821,Amelia,"Daniel was very accomodating and friendly. It was a little pricey for what it was. The bed was smaller than a dormitory bed, and as a college student, I would know. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe but I did get hassled a few times outside of the apartment. Overall, I was impressed but I probably would stay closer to the city center in the future."
2818,54654,6/19/2010,97097,Jenn,Daniel's place was great! We got so much relaxing in. We loved staying there are really appreciated his great hospitality! He gave us great tips on getting around etc. I would recommend his place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam.
2818,58048,6/27/2010,147769,Andrew,"Just a short note - my first experience with AirBnB was with Daniel and it was stellar.  Exactly as indicated and advertised, the service was exemplary.  As a person who does a lot of business travelling, I found Daniel to be an informed and professional host.  Much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  I highly recommend Daniel to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam, the experience was completely positive."
2818,62552,7/8/2010,15745,David,"Daniel was an exceptional host!  I was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:<br/><br/>1) Friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- Along with my reservation I received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at Daniel's doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).<br/><br/>2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel's apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.<br/><br/>3) All the ""little extras"" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.  Everything was well thought-out and Daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb."
2818,73222,8/3/2010,164729,Michel,"Daniel is a great host. He is a very sweet and courteous person and he seems to truly enjoy hosting guests. His apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). He provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that I can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. Daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him.<br/>Thank you Daniel."
2818,74084,8/5/2010,171625,Lezle,"We spent two nights at Daniel's and very much enjoyed it. Early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. The room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. His place is a bit out of the central area of Amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. It was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. We would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!"
515749,6102263,7/30/2013,72642,Will,Great communication by Derk he was quick to respond with any inquiries. The houseboat was really quite large with plenty of room. The bed is very comfortable. The location is very close to the museums however you are a tram ride to the station and some of the main areas of Amsterdam. However their are several tram stops just minutes away from the place.  Highly recommended. 
515749,6150839,8/1/2013,4154919,Ty,"Derk's houseboat is the absolute best place to stay in Amsterdam. There's no better way to experience the city than by staying on the end of a quiet canal in a great area, surrounded by restaurants and walking distance to the museums. The houseboat is spacious and comes with all the comforts of home with the added addition of being able to sit up on deck and take in the canal life. Derk was a great host, going over the quirks of the accommodations and surrounding area with us. Can't wait to come back to Amsterdam and stay here again."
515749,6297784,8/7/2013,465033,Maarit,"A wonderful place to stay in Amsterdam. We enjoyed the location, quiet but so close to many nice areas to wonder in and eat at. We had a great time and enjoyed relaxing on the boat!"
515749,6373581,8/10/2013,1535004,Eleanor,"What a beautiful place to stay!  Really, do stay here if you possibly can - it is a wonderful, spacious boat - plenty of room for two or three people - and on a beautiful canal - a perfect base for exploring Amsterdam. Easy to get to from the center of the city, and a pleasant walk away from the big museums. Derk was very friendly and helpful, even when our flight got in early - a wonderful host! "
785432,3301352,1/7/2013,2231747,Lucie & Max,"Wonderful place to stay in the very center of Amsterdam, the house boat is just perfect, cosy and well equiped. You can see the Hermitage Museum and the City hall from the window. We were here in January so we couldn't really enjoy the roof top, it is surely very pleasant in summer time. Daan was very kind and help us with the car, gave us good advice and tips about the city. He was always availlable to help. Thanx a lot truly for these fews days in Amsterdam, on a Houseboat !"
785432,3437158,1/29/2013,4578307,Silvia,"It has been amazing to spend a week end in Amsterdam sleeping on a houseboat: a unique experience! <br/>The place is very nice and cosy, the host very kind and always availlable for anything you need. <br/>The boat is really in the heart of the city, a very pretty neighbourhood full of restaurants, bars and shops. Also, the Metro station makes very easy to reach the Central Station and the Airport.<br/>I will definitely come back!!"
2818,87063,8/30/2010,175043,Andrew,"Daniel was an excellent host, and I whole heartedly recommend his accomodations. He is pleasant, the place was very clean, and the location was perfect - a 10-15 minute bus or metro ride to downtown and quiet in the evening. On my next visit to Amsterdam, I would absolutely stay with Daniel again. "
2818,91025,9/6/2010,105289,Nadia,Daniel is a fantastic host who cares about the details of his guest's stay in Amsterdam. He was a blessing when it came to getting directions of where we needed to go. He definitely comes excellently-recommended!
785432,3450037,1/31/2013,1803302,Lacey,We had a great time! Thanks so much for welcoming us to Amsterdam!<br/>It was great fun bragging to our friends in NYC that we stayed on the canal.
785432,3574220,2/18/2013,2421794,Marat,"Our experience was amazing! In first, the boat is located in perfect place, near subway and moorings of most popular touristic boat lines. It is really center of Amsterdam. Next advantage is facilities on the boat. At morning you can make a cup of coffee and enjoy it on the boat stern looking at canal and nice buildings and bridge. And finally, just in a few hours you'll have great skill of entering inside boat through the small door :-)"
785432,3614980,2/26/2013,4572050,Barbara,"We've been 4 days on the fantastic houseboat - I only can highly recommend it... As from the beginning with making the reservation, through e-mailing back and forth for clearing details etc. and finally leaving the boat at the end of our stay - everything worked out perfectly. We loved the attitude, the welcoming atmosphere and the caring, we felt from Daan throughout the whole time... Even got a hairdryer shortly of our stay at his boat... <br/>All I can say: we are coming back as soon as possible - the next time preferably in spring or summer to take advantage of the terrace for seizing evening time... <br/>Thanks a lot for everything and cu soon again in beautiful AMS-city - with these great shops, restaurants and the Stadthaus (Theatre and Operahouse) just some meters away from the boat... Barbara"
785432,3691290,3/4/2013,2009045,Paul&Rebecca,"Daan was a great host and we really enjoyed staying in his houseboat.  Location is very nice, apartment was very clean and comfortable."
785432,3744031,3/11/2013,983934,Andrea,"Daan was a super friendly and helpful host. He was very quick to reply to my messages before arrival and also very reliable during the trip.<br/>He had answers to all our questions and adviced us well. Following his recommendation we went to a very nice bar, we would never have found otherwise.<br/>The boat itself is wonderful, as is the location. <br/>It's clean, quite and very comfortable and you reach everything in the city in 10 minutes.<br/>We would go back to stay at Daan's houseboat as soon as we get a chance to. I can highly recommend this place!"
785432,3782902,3/14/2013,5155193,Marc,4 jours formidables à visiter une ville formidable ! Attention malgré tout au froid et au vent en mars...
785432,3814495,3/18/2013,2036440,Marie,"Super séjour, super péniche!<br/>Clean, bien équipée et parfaitement située. Daan a été super avec nous.<br/>On reviendra! (en été, pour profiter un max de la superbe terrasse)"
785432,3927466,3/28/2013,1144382,Maya,"Daan's houseboat was wonderful--GREAT location, clean, completely outfitted for everything you would need, and a lovely rooftop patio for warmer evenings or morning coffee. A fully equipped kitchen allowed us to pick up fresh pasteries, yogurt nd fruit for simple, quick and delicious breakfasts. Daan was incredibly responsive in advance of our arrival, sending great directions and accommodating our early check-in. He also gave us excellent recommendations for dinner both nights that we were there. Highly recommended for a true Amsterdam canal experience."
785432,3944667,3/29/2013,1986682,Thad,"Daan's Houseboat was a treat to stay on. Not only was the boat tidy and comfortable, the location and ambiance was spot on. Daan gave a thorough introduction to staying aboard and was a pleasure to meet.<br/>Our group of five was very satisfied with the evening. I look forward to  staying here again."
785432,3954478,3/30/2013,5560745,Jeroen,"Leuke boot, hele centrale ligging in Amsterdam (Metro Waterlooplein). Schoon en compleet. Eigenaar is flexibel en relaxed."
785432,4024160,4/3/2013,5347016,Chris,"Daan was a great host - helpful and very friendly, which gave us a good impression about the city to start with. <br/><br/>The boat was very spacious, well equipped and amazingly quiet, given there were so much going on outside on the river. There were enough rooms for our group of four adults and two kids. The owner even provided a great collection of DVD titles in his boat so you could always keep yourself entertained. All of us enjoyed the stay very much (my son kept asking me ""when can we go back to our boat?"" when we did our sight seeing there). <br/><br/>The location of the boathouse, as the name indicates, is so central that you are virtually within walking distances to many attractions, Rembrandt House Museum, Heritage Amsterdam (where Van Gogh was exhibited until the end of Apr 2013), Handbags and Purses Museum (the one and only in the world) and many others. I had my best coffee of the trip at a corner coffee shop (Puccini) about 5 min away and the restaurant opposite was equally brilliant (Frenzi)."
785432,4041199,4/5/2013,1484609,Andrea,"We stayed two nights with our three teenage boys at Daan's boat. The boat is brilliant - spacious, perfectly located, equiped with everything you might need, clean and comfortable. We even prefered staying in for the meals to going to a restaurant because being on the boat was such a great fun. Daan is really friendly and very helpful. We had a perfect stay and hope to come back soon. "
785432,4230988,4/21/2013,4654565,Pat,My family (5 adults and a 3 y/o child) and I had a great time on Daan's houseboat! The houseboat  was a conveniently located and supplied all that we needed. The accomodations are clean and comfortable.  Daan was helpful and friendly.  Being directly on the canal offered us a very unique experience.  Loved it!
785432,4267882,4/23/2013,5280762,Sinead,"Myself and three friends stayed on Daan's boat for two nights and we had a great experience. We did not want to leave the boat.: ) It was lovely to be able to sit up on top and watch all the boats going by on the canal. The boat itself was very spacious and very well equipped with everything we could possibly need. The location is really good - only a minute from the metro and there is a bike hire shop a few minutes away. <br/>We found Daan to be very friendly and helpful in suggesting ideas for our stay in Amsterdam. <br/>We would highly recommend staying on this boat and hope that we will be back at some stage in the future. "
785432,4290349,4/25/2013,5124445,Kathleen,We had a wonderful and unique experience staying in Daan's houseboat in Amsterdam. The boat was comfortable and located in a fantastic location near many bars and cafes. It was great to stay on the water and wake up to such a beautiful view!
785432,4321026,4/28/2013,4752867,Cristina,Thanks Daan for making us welcome! Staying in an housboat in Amsterdam was a wonderful experience and we suggest everybody to do the same by you! 
785432,4426860,5/5/2013,3919221,Anna&Paul,"If you are looking for an original place to stay, this houseboat is the good plan! Very comfy and in the center of the city, you will find everything needed on this floating flat. Daan is very helpful and welcoming, don't hesitate! "
785432,4469491,5/7/2013,4722770,Margarita,"The Houseboat was great and if opportunity presents itself, I would repeat the experience.  There was, however, miscommunication between the Owner and a person who was to check us in, which resulted in a bit of panic and lost time."
785432,4610646,5/15/2013,565006,Amy,"Daan and his wife were great hosts. The boat is really cute with a great bathtub and a very comfy bed (and good, fast, free wifi). It was fun to see the other tourists going by on tour boats, taking pictures of me on Daan's boat because they thought I was the real deal. The location is excellent - within a five minute walk of several excellent Indonesian restaurants. All in all, a great way to experience Amsterdam. "
515749,6417228,8/12/2013,3917544,Martine,"Belle expérience originale , le bateau est très bien placé pour le quartier des musées et les restaurants proches.<br/>Derk est quelqu'un de fort sympathique et dévoué ."
515749,6484938,8/14/2013,4129141,Baine,"This was fantastic!  Derk's houseboat was comfortable, perfectly-located, and fun.  Can't think of a better place to stay in Amsterdam.  And Derk was friendly and accommodated our late arrival, which was great.  Hope to go back for a longer time soon!  "
515749,6595696,8/18/2013,7745769,Kelly,"Charming houseboat with a great location. We enjoyed a two night stay, it was quiet and cosy and Derk gave us a lovely welcome. He was also very helpful in sorting out a small problem with the boat and loaning us a iphone charger. Overall a great guy! The houseboat is in a residential street so it was quiet, but close to transport and shops. We had some lovely evenings sitting out on the deck picnicking and watching the world go by. Look for the Albert Heijn supermarket near the corner of Utrecht Straat and Frederiks Plein and the Dirk supermarket in Marie Heineken Plein. Also De Carosel restaurant on Weteringplantsoen makes wonderful pancakes and poffertjies. And on Vijzelgracht go to Holtkamp bakery for appletart and freshly prepared kroketten. It is also a short walk to the newly opened Rijksmuseum. Buy tickets online and arrive shortly before it opens at 9:00 to miss the worst of the crowds and go see The Night Watch by Rembrant first. So enjoyed Amsterdam, great city."
515749,6777413,8/25/2013,5415727,Christophe,"Derk let us have an environment where you will feel quickly as the maison.Une great experience.<br/>The place is quiet and very well placed. we stayed for a week<br/><br/>Thank you Derk"
2818,94243,9/10/2010,202035,Agam,"Daniel's setup was very good.  Like other reviewers have said before, he has a lot of nice little touches and everything is extremely well thought out in providing a seamless experience for his guests.  <br/><br/>Daniel himself was really nice and accommodating.  He helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.<br/><br/>His place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  Also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  So it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.<br/><br/>There are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  Would definitely stay there agin."
2818,97728,9/15/2010,211004,Alexandra,"Our stay at Daniel was awesome. He has a beautiful flat which is very tidy and neat. The room to rent is also very nice. It has two comfy beds and a wardrobe. Daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. There are also towels for which Daniel provides a special space in the bathroom. <br/>What was outstanding, was that Daniel also lent us two of his bikes. This was most helpful as we hadn't to figure out the public transport and were free to discover Amsterdam by bike. Even if you would have to take the bus or tram the appartment is located idealy to various stops. "
2818,105516,9/26/2010,217961,Sam,"my stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of of my visit to amsterdam. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable , but having Daniel as a point of reference was my key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever i had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. The room is located at quite 15 minut from the heart of the city, but i didn't find this hindering. i was able to get to the center in 15 minut. also the bus stop is only 3 minut walk from the house . There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living. I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels.definetly will be goin there again thank you daniel so much for everything u done for me to make my stay very confortable..  <br/><br/>"
515749,6845389,8/27/2013,6578543,Dominique,"Very pleasant experience in quiet and lovely place.<br/>Thanks Derk for your kindness.<br/>Hope come back soon !"
515749,7299328,9/15/2013,5923442,Gary,"September 2013<br/>We stayed 5 nights on Derk's houseboat. He met us for an early check-in after our 7 hour flight from Canada and was most welcoming and helpful giving us advice on what was available in the area. The houseboat was warm and comfortable on a quiet canal away from the busy ""touristy"" area. This was our first stay with Airbnb and we were very pleased with the experience."
515749,7360044,9/17/2013,3594917,Cailey,"Derk's houseboat was lovely! Although we did not get a chance to meet it was very easy to correspond and we had an amazing time. Very cozy bed, next to the tram and walking distance to everything we needed. Location could not be beat! Thanks so much for hosting us Derk!"
785432,4645700,5/18/2013,5171993,Ed,"Superb location on the Amstel near to Rembrandtplein and plenty more bars, cafes and restaurants nearby, as well as being very close to the metro and tram.<br/>Excellent laidback host - we didn't arrive until 10pm but this wasn't a problem and he lives close by in case of any emergencies. He was also a good source of knowledge of the surrounding area.<br/>The houseboat had plenty of room for the four of us with pretty much everything you'd require on a short stay catered for.<br/>Overall highly recommended!!!"
785432,4724696,5/22/2013,2406987,Felix,Excellent host... Very helpfull. Excellent location... The best
785432,4799157,5/27/2013,3293271,Gina,"Daan's houseboat is wonderful! We had a great time linving in there, it's super close located to rembrandtplein & the flea market on waterlooplein. Everything else is about 15min away by foot. The rooftop terrace is lovely on sunny days: we luckily had one evening to test it :) I'll definetly be back here when  I'll travel to Amsterdam with a group of more than 3 people, the experience on a houseboat is simply unique ;) and Daan is so easy going, you'll love him.<br/><br/>Thanks again Daan & tot ziens! ^.^"
785432,4843514,5/28/2013,6280091,Tim,"Booking was easy with Daan.  I texted him once we landed at Schipol and he met us at the boat.   The house boat was excellent.  Plenty of room and very well located.  We really enjoyed sipping coffee on the upper deck and waving at all the tour boats going by.  I think my kids will now be in several hundred photo albums, probably labeled ""friendly local kids yelling 'hallo' to everyone"".  When we go back to Amsterdam, we hope to stay here again."
785432,4864429,5/29/2013,6224166,Andrew,"Had a great time, sitting on the boat in the sun, watching all the boats sail by is fabulous. Daan is a great host, wish we could have stayed longer."
785432,4886186,5/31/2013,4227011,George,"Top location,very convenient to everywhere in Amsterdam,spacious in houseboat,Daan is very helpful. Good kitchen equipment and dining space,I thought it will be some noise at night,but it is very quite as even I could not hear any boat and track noise at all.Very special experience on my life,high recommended people to try,worth the try.<br/>George from Melbourne Australia"
785432,5006419,6/7/2013,2859136,Mark,"Daan was a fantastic host and made the whole process easy. He also gave us some great restaurant recommendations, all of which we tried. The boat is situated on the south end of Nieuwmarkt on the Amstel canal, it's minutes from all the major sections of the city. The boat itself was great, lots of space and and it is the outside boat so you can relax and watch the drunk boats sail by on the canal. The boat comes with a full kitchen, internet and even air conditioning. A great experience, we would definitely use this boat again."
785432,5076583,6/11/2013,2352810,Ionut,"Daan is a great host.<br/><br/>He helped us with the check in and the check out. Living on a boat is la little different that on a house, and there ar some rules that you should comply. These rules are very simple and Daan explains them to you at the beginning. If you listen to him carefully, everything it will be ok. We didn't. But we managed it, we agreed with Daan and in the end it was ok. I hope he will receive us next time as well. :)<br/><br/>It is my second time in Amsterdam, but the first time staying on a boat. It is a totally different experience. Everybody should try it at least once. And Daan's boat is very close to everything. We rented some bikes and everything was 10-15 minutes away. The boat is like in the pictures and the description. If you get sea sick, do not wary. I do too, but in this kind of boat, I had no problems :) We staid 4 people in 2 beds, but it fits 6 people without problems (there ate 2 sofas that could be used).<br/><br/>I repeat myself: If you ar going to Amsterdam, living on a boat is a must have experince, and Daan's boat is very well suited for it:) <br/>"
785432,5307110,6/24/2013,5035178,Rune,"As a first time user of Airbnb I was a bit worried about this trip. Daan made the worries disappear. He was quick to reply to my questions, and made clear agreements prior to our visit. One in Amsterdam he was very friendly, answered our questions and gave us good advice. The houseboat was clean and above expectations. It was such a blast sitting on the deck watching boats passing by. The boat is in close proximity and any kind of good times, but at the same time shielded from noise. Will be back on the boat on my next trip to Amsterdam for sure."
785432,5339540,6/25/2013,3859903,Carmen,"Definitely would have liked to stay longer - great communication, excellent location and view."
785432,5447444,7/1/2013,5155652,Ulrike,"Daan is a very friendly and nice host. The boat was nearly perfect. The location is absolutely fabulous, the boat was clean, just the two fold out beds are a bit tiny for two grown ups (especially man ;)). For a couple it should´t be a problem at all.<br/>We had everything on the boat we needed and really enjoyed our time in Amsterdam.<br/>We could even leave our luggage at Daans place since we had to get out of the boat but still wanted to go for a coffee. <br/>Highly recommended!"
785432,5565466,7/6/2013,1418656,Hester,"We were 5 family members coming from 3 different places and this was a great option for us to be together. Make sure you check out exact address/location with Daan because (Hidden by Airbnb) maps did not locate it very exactly. You do have to walk over another boat to get to the entrance. The houseboat experience was super fun, especially sitting on the deck and watching Amsterdam life go by (tugboats, tourist boats, skullers, small boats, happy hour boats .....). And enjoying the sway of the boat and looking out the windows at boats passing so close that we said hello. Music theatre across street. AH super market and Waterlooplein flea market nearby. Not especially quiet because of the bustle, but not too bad noise wise (except first night a few rowdy street partyers)<br/>The shower door was not working very well, but we managed and we didn't use the tub for environmental reasons (too much water use). The kitchen area was great and 2 rooms were private the third bed is in the main room area, which worked for us.<br/>Daan is a very relaxed and flexible host. I would recommend<br/> this to anyone who wants a fun experience , especially with a group of friends/family.<br/>"
2818,112271,10/5/2010,227259,Diana,"Daniel makes his guests feel completely welcome,  he checks in to make sure you are having a great time and if you need anything further. He is always available by phone. The room is well appointed with maps and information to get you around the Amsterdam seamlessly.  The room is nicely decorated and very clean with a armoire for your clothes so you don't need to live out of your suitcase. I would definitely stay at Daniel's again.  I had a great time."
2818,114145,10/8/2010,224147,Sylvia,"Daniel's place was without a doubt the most rewarding of our trip to Europe. His attention to details and kindness make his place an excellent alternative for those considering a bed and breakfast in Amsterdam<br/>I strongly advise to consider his place: Great location, an affordable price, a clean and organized room and a great host. What else can you ask for?<br/>Thanks Daniel<br/>Hope to see u soon!"
2818,117153,10/12/2010,216750,Darlo,"My sister and I had a awesome experience in Amsterdam and it all started with Daniel, his graciousness as a host - helping us find his quiet apartment, his tea and conversations, maps, comfortable room and accommadations. We would definately stay at Daniel's the next time we visit Amsterdam. "
2818,126525,10/25/2010,241053,Roberto,"Staying st Daniel's was flawless, everything was perfect. Daniel has everything well organized and well planned for the guests. He provides maps and books of Amsterdam, and he is always available for any help you might need.<br/><br/>The room is very quiet, and well decorated, very clean.<br/>He provides the room with towels, tea, coffee and a wardrobe.<br/><br/>I felt very comfortable, I would stay again.

2818,143537,11/23/2010,54482,Marta,"Me and my boyfriend have spent three nights at Daniel´s place, and we are very pleased with the choice. Daniel is charming, always aware that everything was fine. His house is very nice, very clean and beautiful. The room is very nice and the beds are very comfortable. We had at our disposal free bikes, coffee ant tea, guides, towels, hair dryer...<br/>The only downside is that we couldn´t be much with Daniel, who was a lovely person!<br/>If we go back to Amsterdam we would repeat for sure!<br/>Thank you Daniel!"
2818,161816,1/1/2011,329040,Leigh And Stefanie,Daniel provides 5 star service. He is a super nice guy and he is super friendly and well organized. I was traveling with a buddy and everything worked out great. My stay was over a year ago and I only just figured out how to write a review. Happy travels everyone !
2818,194298,3/7/2011,374779,Drew,"Daniel's place is a fantastic place to stay in Amsterdam if you expect to be spending (as you should) most or all of your time out and about in the city. It's particularly well-suited to the solo traveller and Daniel is a fantastic host. <br/><br/>Slightly outside the 'core' of Amsterdam, but transport is extremely convenient and Daniel is hugely accommodating with late-night schedules. <br/><br/>Only thing I'd say is that it is best if you have experienced what European apartments are actually like. Daniel's is really, really nice - but it IS European. If you're fresh off the plane from North America and have never been to Europe before I'd suggest you get a hotel for a few days first. But I'd say that about any European apartment. <br/><br/>Hugely enjoyed my time. Highly recommend.  "
2818,196836,3/11/2011,422476,Colin,"Staying at Daniel's apartment was great! My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights and were very happy to do so. Daniel was a terrific host who made us feel at home. The room we stayed in was lovely and comfortable, and he provided us with a hair dryer, towels, tea and coffee, maps and guide books. He was a wealth of information in terms of when to go to certain museums, what was and wasn't worthwhile, and the best ways to get around using public transportation. He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight. The location of his apartment is also great--near both train and bus stops, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend staying here! "
2818,214718,4/1/2011,442422,Angela,"Daniel's apartment was perfect for my 5 days in Amsterdam (march 2011) and was a great value. It is only 5 minutes away from the bus and is in a safe residential area. The area has public transports, restaurants, laundry, supermarket. The apartment was also very comfortable and very well-equipped. The kitchen, work desk, shower and bathroom were all very nice. It is well maintained, very clean, nicely decorated. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are soft and fragrant. There were beautiful flowers, tea and hot water inside my room. He has an eye for everything, is friendly and very professional. Daniel arranged everything and advised me before the trip. His manager went well beyond to answer my daily questions, taught me how travel around the city, and was nearby most times or quickly responded to my messages.  In short: go to Amsterdam, rent Daniel's appartment and be happy. Thanks again, Daniel for a great stay! Angela (Brazil)."
2818,232163,4/19/2011,485490,Aisling,"Great Trip, accomodation was very clean and Daniel was very welcoming and professional. He provides hotel-like accomodation with a real feeling of Amsterdam. Would highly recommend a stay at Daniel's. "

785432,5696026,7/12/2013,6762783,Lisa,"We had a great time on Daan's houseboat. He made a good arrangement for us to get the key even though we were later than expected, and he arranged for a taxi to get us to the airport at the end of our stay. This was a great way to experience Amsterdam and the houseboat was conveniently located near the intersection of all of the canal bus routes. Fridge was nicely stocked with useful ingredients, there were useful guides to Amsterdam onboard. Everything worked. Plenty of towels and linen. I would recommend this to couples or families that want to have an authentic experience of Amsterdam"
785432,5747341,7/15/2013,1907589,Anna,This was a very nice experience.  Daan is very helpful and available for questions.  Perfect central location.  Our kids were very excited to sleep on a houseboat!
785432,5804696,7/17/2013,2060773,Chelsea,We had the most beautiful relaxing holiday staying on Daan's canal boat. Daan took the time to help us settle in and recommend authentic Dutch restaurants. Very comfortable accommodation. Highly recommend..
785432,6000071,7/26/2013,3203515,Pearlie,Daan's houseboat is amazing - very spacious and comfortable! It's easy to reach and in perfect distance to the centre! We had a great time there! Daan is cool and helpful guy!!! We sure will come back! Thanks for having us! 
785432,6144165,8/1/2013,4767808,Noel,Ideal canal location in the heart of Amsterdam. Host was extremely helpful throughout the stay with advice on eating shopping. A couple of minor issues were fixed up without delay.
785432,6453809,8/13/2013,5398089,David,"Heureux et plaisant voyage dans une ville superbe.<br/>La péniche est confortable, pratique, et surtout idéalement située dans un cadre innoubliable.<br/>Dann, le propriétaire est disponible, toujours là en cas de besoin, prêt à apporter de l'aide, à répondre aux questions et à donner des conseils.<br/>Je le conseillerais donc à des amis ou à des membres de ma famille, sans problème."
785432,6843202,8/27/2013,5625222,Sheila,What a fabulous way to visit Amsterdam! The houseboat is spacious and comfortable and conveniently located close to the action without being too noisy. The upper deck was great for morning coffee and evening drinks while enjoying the passing boats of every shape and size. <br/>Daan's a great host with helpful hints of where to go for good food and even helped us by booking our taxi to the airport. He even provided tea and coffee. <br/>We highly recommend a stay on his boat. 
515749,7409901,9/19/2013,2727862,Emilio,supero mis espectativas. el barco contaba con todo lo necesario. ubicado en un hermoso canal lleno de patos!
515749,7597553,9/26/2013,4668309,Beverly,"Derk is an excellent host, he was there to meet us and gave us lots of guidance. The houseboat is rustic, the bed comfortable , everything works well, and the location decent. It's about a 15 minute walk to the Rijks Museum and Van Gogh Gallery.  And, best of all, it's a block from the tram that goes directly to and from the train station. "
515749,7766531,10/2/2013,172664,John,"Derk's houseboat is a great place to stay and Derk is a fine host. The location was perfect for us - a 10 minutes walk to the Rijksmuseum. Derk plays in one of Amsterdam's fine orchestras, and he got us inexpensive tickets to a wonderful concert. We will stay on his boat again when we return."
515749,7958821,10/10/2013,2262959,Tero,"Derk was a great, very active host. The houseboat itself was exactly what I expected regarding the amenities and the location could not have been better, basically walking distance from everything important downtown (eg. Rijksmuseum). Also, I was really surprised how peaceful the surroundings were, considering how central the location is. We are definitely going to book this again when we return to Amsterdam."
515749,7999576,10/12/2013,1759329,Jesper,We had a great stay at Derks lovely and autentic houseboat. Nice and cosy location.

It is in located in a quiet street and in a walking distance from most places. Derk was very kind and gave us a lot of information about the city. We would certainly stay there again! 
515749,8149373,10/18/2013,5144287,Kirsten,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on Derk's houseboat. Very comfortable and homely - and moored in a quiet, picturesque and convenient location. Derk was a perfect host. He gave us a warm welcome and supplied us with all the information we needed. In particular, Derk really went out of his way to help us when an emergency situation which had nothing to do with the accommodation arose - and everything was 'fixed' :-). Thank you very much, Derk! We fully recommend the genuine Amsterdam experience of staying on Derk's houseboat - and will make an extra effort not to create too much 'trouble' when we return one day ;-)"
2818,260298,5/12/2011,229991,Marsha,"Daniel is an amazing host!  The room is exceptionally comfortable, very good mattresses, very pretty, light and airy.  There is a tea service area with a small fridge that was very convenient.  The environment was exceptionally clean, organized and Daniel has maps and a wealth of information available for tourists.  He was great at helping us to make arrangements for tourist tickets online.  The most wonderful thing about his location is the neighborhood, especially if you are looking for a local experience.  It was very easy to use the public transit system from his location.  Everything is close.  Daniel offered bikes to use and that was fabulous.  Daniel did everything possible to provide a pleasant experience and we had an amazing time.  I highly recommend Daniel's place.  "
2818,314616,6/14/2011,636413,Sabine,We spent  a few day by Daniel. We have a very good accomotion. Daniel is very kind and busy man for his guest. We will come back to Amsterdam and defently go to Daniel. 
2818,330647,6/23/2011,668411,Marcia,"Daniel is a welcoming and accommodating host who is interesting to talk with. The room is attractive and very comfortable. The location is not far by public transport from anything that you might want to do in Amsterdam. Don't hesitate to ask Daniel questions about things to do, how to get there, and especially places to eat. His recommendations are excellent!<br/><br/>We loved our stay in Amsterdam and would gladly stay with Daniel again."
2818,341388,6/28/2011,711463,Sunny,"Daniel is a very kind, helpful, and nice host. We were amazed at his careful attention at every detail for the guests. Everything was very clean as a nice hotel. The room is so cozy and bright, you can even see a nice little garden from the window. <br/><br/>We did not plan much for this trip, but on the first night we could perfectly plan out everything with the resources Daniel provided us. All the travel guides and efficient maps are in the room! <br/><br/>If you a big fan of Thai food, ask Daniel where to go for your first meal in Amsterdam near his place- it was THE BEST. <br/><br/>Thank you Daniel!!!<br/>Sunny K"

515749,8344117,10/27/2013,1232172,Rachael,"What a perfect way to spend time in beautiful Amsterdam.<br/>The boat is central, quiet, well equipped and comfortable.<br/>I would love to stay there again."
515749,8522062,11/4/2013,8777143,Jean-Marie,"Très belle péniche dans un quartier calme d'Amsterdam… Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour à Amsterdam. Derk est très sympathique et serviable.<br/>Bref… A refaire !"
515749,8897927,11/25/2013,8948064,Michael,"Das Hausboot ist sehr gemütlich, überraschend hell durch die Deckenlichter und wurde durch die Gasheizung sehr schnell warm - auch im kalten November. Außerdem ist das Hausboot für 2 Personen sehr geräumig. <br/><br/>Es ist sehr ruhig gelegen und trotzdem nur 5 bis 10 Minuten zu Fuß vom Altstadt-Zentrum von Amsterdam entfernt.<br/><br/>Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt - vielen Dank, Derk!<br/><br/>Sehr zu empfehlen!"
515749,8958059,11/28/2013,9678717,Christopher,Derk's houseboat is fantastic and located on a beautiful and quiet canal that's still close to everything. He was very helpful and our arrival and departure were smooth and easy. 
515749,9057232,12/3/2013,3097746,Denis,"We definitely liked our stay in Amsterdam on Derk's houseboat! It was great experience. Derk was very nice and hospitable, he advised us some nice local cafes and bars. The boat itself is very cosy and comfortable. It is located on quite canal so you won't be disturbed by crowds of tourists and could have some privacy, but if you want to go to some central streets it takes about 5-10 minutes by foot. We enjoyed our weekend in Amsterdam very much thanks to Derk and his beautiful boat."
515749,9225153,12/15/2013,1855886,Julie,"My husband and I stayed at Derk's boat for three days in December and absolutely loved it! We found the place spotless, with all the necessary amenities (good coffee maker, hot shower, great bed, wifi.. etc.). We felt at home right away and couldn't get enough of the views from the boat onto our peaceful canal... I mean, you can see the towers of the Rijksmuseum from it - you cannot beat that! <br/>It is a great place to explore Amsterdam. There are tram stops close by, a grocery store 5 minutes away, nice cafés and bars close by too. Derk is a great host, easy to communicate with and very accommodating. This is a very special place to stay in and I highly recommend it."
515749,9295115,12/19/2013,9257120,Grant,"Such a fun and awesome place to stay in Amsterdam. Thoroughly enjoyed myself. <br/><br/>The houseboat has everything you could need, and was deliciously warm and cosy in winter. Very well located, central, in a picturesque part of town.<br/><br/>Desk was a great host, gave a thorough introduction to not only the accommodation, but also the city itself....even when I arrived quite late at night.<br/><br/>Thanks for an amazing experience!"
515749,9494779,12/31/2013,1114174,Jake And Cristine,"Derk was an excellent host and the boathouse was perfect. Charming place that's conveniently located. We would do it again in a heartbeat. Thanks, Derk!"
515749,9590866,1/3/2014,2254214,Justinas,"Very friendly host and great, beautiful, clean boat - thank you Derk! We enjoyed our stay (3 nights) very much and would be happy to come again.<br/>Justi & Klari"
515749,11057902,3/18/2014,12607062,Susanne,Wunderschönes Hausboot und auch noch in einer Top-Lage! Wir haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt und würden jederzeit wiederkommen. 
515749,11154170,3/23/2014,10277981,Lesley,Derek was a great host! The ship was a great way to see Amsterdam. Derek was very friendly and gave us great advice about where to go in the city. I would recommend his ship to anyone. 
515749,11357907,3/31/2014,12546371,Ulf,Wonderful! Perfect Location and perfect host!
515749,11457056,4/3/2014,13384725,Martina,"Ein schönes Hausboot, mit einem sehr freundlichen und sympathischen Gastgeber. Die Lage ist perfekt - ruhig, jedoch trotzdem direkt am Zentrum (5-10 Minuten zu Fuß). <br/>Jederzeit gerne wieder :)"
515749,11483904,4/5/2014,8744260,Suzanna,"We stayed on Derk's boat for two nights and absolutely loved it. The boat is easy to get to by bus from the main train station and right near all manner of shops and sights. It was very spacious and comfortable, and was almost more like an apartment than a boat. I was a little worried about the toilet/shower situation beforehand (from other boat experiences) but they worked great! Derk was also easy to get ahold of and flexible with our  travel schedule. I would highly recommend this place! "
515749,11536244,4/7/2014,11690130,Stacie,"Derk's houseboat was fantastic! When we first arrived, Derk was there to greet us and provide helpful tips about the city. I couldn't have imagined a better place to stay for our weekend away in Amsterdam. "
515749,11693741,4/12/2014,1412783,Steven,"Booked a two night stay which turned out to have been double booked by airbnb.<br/>Derk handled it perfectly by providing us a different boat for each night at the same location. Would definitely recommand staying here."
515749,11733440,4/14/2014,5324567,Ben,"A cute house boat on a cute quiet canal. My favorite moment of the trip was waking up in the morning and having coffee outside on the boat, watching the ducks play in the canal and the view of the Rijksmuseum in the distance. Tip: It's much cheaper to take a tram from Centraal Station than a taxi. Derk was a great host, and very attentive to what we needed!"
785432,6909963,8/30/2013,1782511,Ralf,"Awesome place to be. Even people living in Amsterdam are jealous of this houseboat, since there are only about 2500 of them on the Grachten. It's quiet and on a sunny evening you're basicly the king of the world sitting on your houseboat-terrace until the sun sets. Daan is someone who knows his way around amsterdam, he can practically tell you anything and knows where to go. We had a great time, and will be back for sure."
785432,7032142,9/4/2013,2628722,Craig,We had a great time. Daan was a wonderful host. When we first arrived it was night and we were so confused by the quaint narrow roads. Dan gave turn by turn directions by cell phone and was standing in front waving when we got there.  No better way to visit Amsterdam then a stay on a houseboat. Daan's place is comfortable and well appointed. It is within easy walking distance of major museums & attractions. Daan also told us about a wonderful place for breakfast. Only regret is we couldn't stay longer. 
785432,7189906,9/10/2013,3339671,Ruggero,"The Houseboat is an experience: a perfect place to enjoy Amsterdam. Was amazing to be there for our group of friends, and Daan made everything possible to make us feel more than welcome. The house is cozy and right in the center, everything is in walking distance and the terrace is an incredible place to enjoy the time and have a drink.<br/>A dream!"
785432,7237823,9/13/2013,6243399,Emily,"The absolute perfect way to experience Amsterdam. This houseboat is truly in the best possible location for visiting Amsterdam. Near everything! We were so happy we found this listing.<br/><br/>The boat was super clean and modern and so comfortable. The shower was even fantastic! <br/><br/>Daan was an awesome host. He showed us everything, but then trusted us during our whole stay and we were never bothered.<br/><br/>ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. A gem of a place.<br/><br/>Just look for the house number when trying to find it. We walked past it a few times. <br/><br/>Highly recommend. Thanks, Daan for everything!"
785432,7322406,9/16/2013,5574324,Signe,"Everything was as agreed, fine and cool! "
785432,7383818,9/17/2013,697222,Rand,"Daan and his houseboat experience is entirely easy and very accomodating. The best way to spend some time in Amsterdam, on the water like that<br/>"
785432,7431048,9/20/2013,5116032,Kate,"We had such a wonderful time on Daan's Houseboat.  The location is amazing and it felt really special after 3 weeks of hotels to step on and off a boat.<br/>Daan met us on the first day and gave us a tour of the boat and made sure that we were happy to ask any questions during our stay there.  After that we didn't see him until we checked out but knew he was right there if we needed him.<br/>The boat is really well equipped and the attention to detail is lovely.  <br/><br/>Really great.  Highly recommended!<br/>"
785432,7466449,9/21/2013,2550926,Alana,"Not only was staying on a houseboat a novel way to experience Amsterdam, the location was perfect as were the amenities.  Daan was very helpful and happy to offer tourism advice.  The houseboat interior was new, clean and contained all necessary items for a holiday - clean towels, toaster, kettle with tea and coffee, kitchenware and lots of extra bedding. I couldn't recommend staying here highly enough!"
785432,7620924,9/27/2013,7619732,Roy,"Thank you Daan for an  unforgettable stay in a truely amazing city.<br/>We had 4 adults and 2 kids and everone had an amazing time with plenty of space for all on the boat.<br/>This is the perfect accommodation in the perfect location and I have already promised several friends I will show them this beautiful city from this spot! <br/>"
785432,7783053,10/2/2013,6933730,James,Lovely boat in a great central location. Thanks Daan!
785432,7825144,10/5/2013,6421277,Rohan,"Daan's boat is very centrally located. We stayed with three small children (9,4 and 2) and there were no issues with safety at all. The boat could accommodate up to 4 single adults or three couples, but the beds would be a bit tight for the latter. The facilities were very good and given its excellent location, it was still relatively quiet at night time. There is also very good access to the tram network from the boat with the No. 14 going straight to the Westermarkt and Anne Frank Huis and a little further long nearer to the Muntplein (perhaps a 10 minute walk) the No. 16 goes directly to the Museumplein (in behind the Rijksmuseum, Steedelijk Museum and van Gogh Museum). There are several restaurants and eateries in the neighbourhood, with the Rembrantplein only a 5 minute walk away. However, with the good access to the trams virtually on the front door step, you can safely venture further a field and eat in other parts of the city and still get home in comfort as we did a couple of times. Daan also helped to arrange an excellent taxi driver who drove us to the airport at Schiphol for around 45 Euros in  morning traffic. The driver was punctual, drove safely and his vehicle was also very clean.We would recommend Daan's boat as houseboats are quintessentially an Amsterdam icon and a really cool way to stay in a fabulous city!"
785432,7912433,10/8/2013,3985795,Markus,Bei Daan in Amsterdam hat alles Bestens geklappt. Wir haben die Zeit auf und im Boot genossen. Das schlafen ist sehr entspannt und auch ruhig. Gerne ein anderes Mal wieder. Markus und Andrea
785432,7965650,10/10/2013,4638959,Babs,Nice and quite boat in the centre of Amsterdam with all the stuff you need. I really appreciated the coffee and tea  who were available. We stayed there with 5 adults (not couples) and some beds were maybe quite small but okay. Daan was very flexible to meet and hand the keys and to help with all special needs from my colleagues :-)...
785432,8002193,10/12/2013,8698082,Elisha,The houseboat was amazing!!!! Daan was so great and told us all the local pubs to get a great feed and a cold beer! The houseboat was so beautiful just sitting and enjoying all the boats go by. 10/10
2818,359800,7/8/2011,400176,Sharon,"Daniel is a phenomenal host; he has everything you could need and has an answer for every question we had.  The room is better than the photo and the accomodations were wonderful.  Daniel was great with communication both before and during our stay.  The location has easy access to tram, bus, stores, restaurants, and pubs - all within walking distance. I will definitely stay with Daniel again and I have already recommended his room to family and friends."
2818,369637,7/12/2011,772352,David,"Daniel is an outstanding host. He is extraordinarily organized & tidy. The room was spotless, and the two beds were comfortable. There is quite a lot of space, and a beautiful view of his backyard garden out the bedroom window. It is so nice to open the windows and see greenery and hear the chirping birds. It is an easy 10-15 minute bike ride to Amsterdam Centraal Station, and all the rest that the city has to offer. Highly recommended! I would definitely stay again."
2818,510827,9/7/2011,909454,Yana,"Daniels's place is really fantastic and he was a great host! <br/><br/>His place is beautifully decorated and very clean and no detail is lost to the make the stay very comfortable for his guests. From the latest cover of ""time out amsterdam"" to color coded towel rack for guests, to the most comfortable beds and pillows, latest travel books,  keys for each guest, his place set a high standard of what Airbnb should be like.<br/><br/>Especially grateful for countless hours Daniel put into helping my travel parner with her lost passport/wallet in another country, and having a converter for my mac.<br/><br/>His home was quiet and peaceful, and he has a lovely garden. The bus is a block away, supermarket 2 blocks away, and a great restaurant Bahnus(?) is 2-3 blocks away, serves very good dinner.<br/><br/>Highly recommend his home for exploring Amsterdam. There is a park  about 20 minutes away that's a must see for a flower lover, it's called Oosterpark and it was delightful!"
2818,515199,9/9/2011,801728,Dominic,"Our stay with Daniel was enjoyable - our only complaint was the non-stop-rain during our visit, and really Daniel could have done nothing about this!"
2818,542894,9/18/2011,1033494,Franziska,"Daniel is a great host, he is very helpful and he can give you any info about amsterdam you need. The room as well as the bathroom and toilet are very clean. Daniel's place is located 1,4 km away from a park+ride, in a nice neighborhood and is really good connected to the city center.  Highly recommended!"
2818,554817,9/21/2011,1119102,Adam,"Daniel was the definition of a fantastic host. His place was impeccable. When we arrived (which was late, and our ETA was changed a few times due to travel woes), our beds were made, clean towels neatly wrapped, soothing music playing, and the smell of fresh eucalyptus/mint filled the air. Overall, a fantastic experience I would recommend to everyone. <br/><br/>Thanks Daniel!<br/>Adam&Jess"
2818,698543,11/7/2011,62868,Rachel,"Daniel was an absolute dream host. His place is so clean, he is EXTREMELY organized and super sweet. We had such a great time in Amsterdam and Daniel had a major part of that. I can't tell you how much I recommend staying with him! THANKS DANIEL!!!!!!"
2818,825414,1/2/2012,1475799,Dhaval,Daniel is a great host even before reaching AMS he gave us good directions on how to get to his place. Leaving @ Daniels was wonderful. He has a great place in a quiet neighboorhood with easy access to trams and busses to get to the centraal station in 15 mins. On our arrival he shared a lot of good information about places to visit. We had an extra guest at the last minute and he was more than happy to accommodate  him in the living room. AMS is awesome and would definitely like to visit back and would stay @Daniels again :)
2818,1084419,4/4/2012,1315953,Miriam,"We felt very much welcomed at Daniel's place. Very thing is well organized, you are provided with eveything you need, the room is pleasant and Daniel is a sensitive and sensible host. It felt a bit like home :-) "
2818,1194128,4/28/2012,2133939,Christina,"Daniel was a great host! This was our first time staying in a B&B and let's just say he set the bar really high. His home was extremely clean and very well organized. The garden view was so peaceful. Both my bf and myself were sick during our Europe trip and Daniel was kind enough to offer us lozenges for our sore throats. He was also very helpful by providing maps, magazines on things to do and any other advice we needed. The room came equipped with coffee and tea and WiFi. His home is very close to public transportation and getting to central Amsterdam was a breeze. If I ever come back to Amsterdam I would definitely be staying at his place again. "
2818,1437274,6/8/2012,1899497,Fareeha,"I have nothing but praise for this gem of a place. Daniel is an exceptional host- he helped us carry our luggage, poured us juice, and gave us so many useful information that made our stay in Amsterdam truly memorable. The room provided a 5* experience and has everything you would possibly need for your stay. The apartment is tastefully decorated with beautiful artwork that is truly inspiring. If you are in Amsterdam, this is the place you should stay. You won't regret it. :)"

2818,1594647,6/30/2012,2481566,Amilcar,"I stayed with my partner at Daniel's place for almost a week and we see Daniel as the perfect host. From the first moment he welcomed us in a very kindly, respectful and positive way. He provided us information about many places to go and he was always showing us the best alternatives in Amsterdam. At his home everything is perfectly organized and clean, the room is nice, cozy, comfortably, quiet and is located in a nice neighboorhood and very well connected. Definitively Daniel has done everything as possible to make our stay more enjoyable. The place is perfect and highly recommended."
2818,1872771,8/2/2012,3018525,Luis,"I was most satisfied with my stay in Daniel's place.  It was cozy, clean, and quiet.  Daniel was very helpful in giving directions on how to best get to his place with a bit of luggage.  On getting there he gave me directions on how best to get to do what I wanted in the time I had.  He provided privacy though I knew he was there to provide any help he could if needed.  I would recommend his place to my friends.  His place is in a very convenient and safe area.  I would definitely look into his place if I had another chance to go to Amsterdam. Thanks, Daniel."

785432,8155925,10/18/2013,9040569,Dave,"Dan was a nice guy. Met us at the boat even though we were running late. The boat itself was a very unique and cool experience.<br/>A nice way to visit Amsterdam. Only issue was I only stayed there 1 night. Need about a week."
785432,8339705,10/26/2013,4829635,Sara,We had a fantastic time on the houseboat! Wonderful location and very easy to find. So nice to sit at night and watch the other boats go by. Everything was wonderful!
785432,8451090,10/31/2013,9438239,Enno,"Daan was a great host; easy to reach, responsive, and flexible. He even recommended some kid-friendly restaurants in the area and made reservations for us. The boat itself is very comfortable and a huge novelty for the whole family."
785432,8465872,11/1/2013,7184551,Andie,"Our group of 6 had one night in Amsterdam, between a two week safari in East Africa and our return to Canada. As luck would have it, Daan's houseboat was available. The description and pictures are accurate- the beds were comfy and the space was perfect for us to spread out and relax. The roof deck was great and it was such fun to be the creatures on display for passing tour boats! <br/><br/>The location was very central with museums and other attractions anywhere from a 5 to 30 minute walk. My youngest (8 years old) had been nervous about the boat option as she has been seasick in the past- but even though we occasionally felt motion when boats passed by, she was fine and would absolutely go back again.  Next time we will stay longer! <br/><br/>Daan arranged for a cab for us from the airport and since his boat is a couple of doors down, we were confident that he could be reached in any (Website hidden by Airbnb) one point there was an issue with the shower drain, but he fixed it immediately.<br/><br/>In short- if you will be staying in Amsterdam, and have the opportunity to stay on Daan's boat- absolutely give yourself this once-in-a  lifetime treat!"
785432,8483169,11/2/2013,9067014,Christine,"Very well-equipped and comfortable houseboat. Not a ""boutique"" decorated boat but functional and spacious enough to accommodate 5 persons without stress.<br/>Very welcoming host<br/>Very centrally located.<br/>A real ""on water"" feeling, yet very quiet and enabling a good sleep"
515749,11770474,4/14/2014,13765348,Christophe,Everything perfect. The houseboat is well located to visit Amsterdam downtown and very quiet and pleasant. You can warm the houseboat very quickly. Derk was very helpful and he is a person you can trust.
515749,11832464,4/16/2014,12447358,Kim,What a treat to tell our friends that we were able to stay in a houseboat on our honeymoon! Derk's place was so spacious and very convenient (within walking distance to several museums and many restaurants). Public transport was easily  accessible also. Derk was very accommodating to our check in and check out schedule which was great. Thanks Derk!
515749,11989913,4/21/2014,11928619,Lukas,"Derk is a perfect host. Right after our arriving he provided us with lots of useful information. the boat itselt is in perfect condition. we walked directly from rhe centraal station since it's a nice way to gain first insights. and it does not take you longer than 15min. <br/>we definitely recommend derk, we enjoyed every minute on the boat. if we ever come back there is a unique place to stay :)"
515749,12145378,4/24/2014,864200,Maree,"OMG! Absolute highlight of our month long trip! I had looked at a lot of houseboats, some looked like 5 star hotels but chose this because it had character. I am so glad we did. It was full of character and much more spacious than it looks. The location is fantastic, in a beautiful quiet part of town. On top of that you have Derk the host, what an absolute gem he is. Really helpful, nothing too much trouble. I cannot speak highly enough about the boat and the host. I am trying to organise another trip to Amsterdam as it is now my favourite city, and I would definitely be staying at Derk's place. Thanks Derk, hope to see you soon!!"
515749,12327268,4/29/2014,11129120,Gemma,"A fantastic way to have your own private space & comfort right in the middle of the city.  Derk was very relaxed and welcoming & the boat is incredible!  We even found a washing machine under the stairs on day 3, which took me 10 steps closer to convincing my partner that we should live on a boat full time ;-)"
