       "      <td>If you want the authentic Amsterdam houseboat experience, this is it!  It is a great boat, located on a quiet canal with a view of the Rijksmuseum towers.  Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, hot shower, good wifi signal, nice kitchen with fridge, cofee maker, and stove for cooking meals.  The location is very accessible to museums, gym bar and bakery on the corner, nine streets area with lots of resaraunts and bars and jazz clubs, Vondelpark, shopping on Utrechtstraat, and all of the sites of central Amsterdam.  \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Now for the special part: If you are at all interested in boats and maritime history, this one is a great find.  The cabin where guests stay is actually the cargo hold within the original hull of a freight boat that once hauled goods all over Holland.  (Just imagine the countless tons of cargo that came in and out of the place where you are sleeping!)  And yet the interior beautifully and comfortably remodeled using new and salvaged materials including a number of hatches that serve as skylights.  The original steerhouse is still intact, along with the original one-cylinder engine down below.  But the highlight is the captain's quarters where the family who owned and operated the boat lived during the 1920s (not open for guests to sleep in, yet).  Stepping down into the quarters, complete with original cabinets and cookstove, feels like traveling back in time.  The host cares a lot about preserving the historical character of his boat, because most other boats like it have long since gone to the scrapyard.  He showed us fascinating photographs of the original owners who lived on the boat when it plied the canals nearly 100 years ago.  \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;There are many houseboats in Amsterdam.  A lot of them are glorified trailer houses on flat barges.  This one is a gem.</td>\n",

I couldn't recommend staying with Derk any more highly.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Coolest thing first: We showed up to Derk's and he actually had three houseboats in a row, and offered to show up the one we saw on the site and another, and let us choose our favorite to stay in!  We had an incredible boat with wired internet, a comfortable bed and a very comfortable futon, TV, speakers, hot water, a shower, washer/dryer.  I couldn't believe I was on a boat.  Plus the charm of being on one was fantastic, and the views out onto the canal were fantastic.  It rained one morning and was such a beautiful way to wake up.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Derk was really communicative, responded to our last minute (day before!) request for a reservation quite casually, and met us right at the boat.  He even had a few cold beers in the fridge for us, and was really great explaining the area.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Would recommend!</td>\n",

We didn't want to stay in the typical Amsterdam hotel and opted for something special - a traditional Dutch houseboat.  Needless to say staying on a boat was a special experience, but the boat was very clean, was on a quiet canal in a superb location in central Amsterdam, and had everything we needed for a memorable weekend.  The owner was good to make some worthwhile recommendations for us and was very flexible with the boat itself (he offered us his other boat in case we preferred that one), etc.  I will definitely try to book this houseboat again when I return to Amsterdam next.</td>\n",

The place was nice and clean. Very quiet neighborhood. He had maps and a lonely planet guide book in the room for you to use. I didnt have any trouble finding the place from Central Station. I would defintely come back! Thanks!  \n",
       "1    If you want the authentic Amsterdam houseboat experience, this is it!  It is a great boat, located on a quiet canal with a view of the Rijksmuseum towers.  Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, hot shower, good wifi signal, nice kitchen with fridge, cofee maker, and stove for cooking meals.  The location is very accessible to museums, gym bar and bakery on the corner, nine streets area with lots of resaraunts and bars and jazz clubs, Vondelpark, shopping on Utrechtstraat, and all of the sites of central Amsterdam.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Now for the special part: If you are at all interested in boats and maritime history, this one is a great find.  The cabin where guests stay is actually the cargo hold within the original hull of a freight boat that once hauled goods all over Holland.  (Just imagine the countless tons of cargo that came in and out of the place where you are sleeping!)  And yet the interior beautifully and comfortably remodeled using new and salvaged materials including a number of hatches that serve as skylights.  The original steerhouse is still intact, along with the original one-cylinder engine down below.  But the highlight is the captain's quarters where the family who owned and operated the boat lived during the 1920s (not open for guests to sleep in, yet).  Stepping down into the quarters, complete with original cabinets and cookstove, feels like traveling back in time.  The host cares a lot about preserving the historical character of his boat, because most other boats like it have long since gone to the scrapyard.  He showed us fascinating photographs of the original owners who lived on the boat when it plied the canals nearly 100 years ago.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>There are many houseboats in Amsterdam.  A lot of them are glorified trailer houses on flat barges.  This one is a gem.  \n",

I couldn't recommend staying with Derk any more highly.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Coolest thing first: We showed up to Derk's and he actually had three houseboats in a row, and offered to show up the one we saw on the site and another, and let us choose our favorite to stay in!  We had an incredible boat with wired internet, a comfortable bed and a very comfortable futon, TV, speakers, hot water, a shower, washer/dryer.  I couldn't believe I was on a boat.  Plus the charm of being on one was fantastic, and the views out onto the canal were fantastic.  It rained one morning and was such a beautiful way to wake up.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>In addition, Derk was really communicative, responded to our last minute (day before!) request for a reservation quite casually, and met us right at the boat.  He even had a few cold beers in the fridge for us, and was really great explaining the area.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Would recommend!  \n",

We didn't want to stay in the typical Amsterdam hotel and opted for something special - a traditional Dutch houseboat.  Needless to say staying on a boat was a special experience, but the boat was very clean, was on a quiet canal in a superb location in central Amsterdam, and had everything we needed for a memorable weekend.  The owner was good to make some worthwhile recommendations for us and was very flexible with the boat itself (he offered us his other boat in case we preferred that one), etc.  I will definitely try to book this houseboat again when I return to Amsterdam next.  \n",

Absolute highlight of our month long trip! I had looked at a lot of houseboats, some looked like 5 star hotels but chose this because it had character. I am so glad we did. It was full of character and much more spacious than it looks. The location is fantastic, in a beautiful quiet part of town. On top of that you have Derk the host, what an absolute gem he is. Really helpful, nothing too much trouble. I cannot speak highly enough about the boat and the host. I am trying to organise another trip to Amsterdam as it is now my favourite city, and I would definitely be staying at Derk's place. Thanks Derk, hope to see you soon!!  \n",

Derk was very relaxed and welcoming & the boat is incredible!  We even found a washing machine under the stairs on day 3, which took me 10 steps closer to convincing my partner that we should live on a boat full time ;-)  \n",
